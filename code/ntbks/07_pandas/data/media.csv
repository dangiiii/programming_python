0,76,"The Democratic Unionist party cannot be allowed to veto any Brexit deal on the Irish border, Ireland’s deputy prime minister has said.  Simon Coveney spoke out after Theresa May disclosed that she was considering the option of giving the Northern Ireland devolved government a veto on any proposed regulatory barrier between itself and the rest of the UK.  The Sun reported on Saturday that the prime minister was pushing for an alternative set of regulatory arrangements for Northern Ireland, but that this was being blocked by the DUP , which is propping up her government. Coveney said: “We cannot allow one party in Northern Ireland to veto any proposals.”  He told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane radio show: “The British government has a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP, but we don’t have a confidence and supply agreement with any one party in Northern Ireland .”  Speculation is growing that the EU and the British government are working on a “backstop to a backstop” to resolve the impasse in Brexit negotiations over the Irish border.  On Friday, May revealed she would be setting out the UK’s alternative, which would involve an element of decision-making power being wielded by Belfast.  “It will be in line with the commitments we made back in December – including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland executive and assembly agree,” she said in her statement .  The assembly has not been functioning since power-sharing collapsed in Northern Ireland almost two years ago because of a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin. It is highly unlikely that Stormont will be restored to full operation before a Brexit deal is sealed.  May rejected the EU’s proposed wording for the backstop proposal in February because it would require the region to stay in the EU system even if the UK crashed out with no deal.  Coveney told RTÉ there was “no question of a border down the Irish Sea”, but he was keen to ensure that minimal checks were required on goods. “There are practical realities of trade, and we are trying to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom in a way that is threatening to unionism, but that can protect the concerns of both unionists and nationalists, neither of whom want a border re-emerging on the island of Ireland.”  He said he believed the DUP recognised that Northern Ireland was not the same “as Kent or a borough in London” and it had many differences from other parts of the UK.  The Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday that the “third option” for Northern Ireland would focus on extending the current regulatory checks on animals to other sectors. To protect the island of Ireland from outbreaks of disease, such as TB or mad cow disease, routine checks are done on livestock being imported from Britain, north and south of the border.  The DUP has accepted that these “sanitary checks” are in place but are opposed to extending this to non-agricultural goods.  Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, confirmed in Salzburg that the EU was reworking the backstop proposal to say that agriculture and phyto-sanitary checks would be the only physical controls that needed to take place between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  In this scenario, customs declaration forms would be filed to tax authorities electronically, and the separate customs checks needed to prevent tax evasion and smuggling would continue.  It is argued that these checks are usually intelligence-led, based on tips-offs to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or Garda Síochána, and are part of the existing cooperation arrangements.",3,2018-09-23 23:33:02

2,78,"T he official theme of this year’s UN general assembly is “ making the United Nations relevant to all people ” but everyone attending next week’s sprawling summit in New York knows that one person is more relevant than others.  Donald Trump is expected to dominate proceedings.  He will chair a meeting on drug trafficking on Monday, address the full assembly on Tuesday and then preside over a security council session on nuclear perils on Wednesday. No one doubts he will use those appearances to show disdain for diplomatic niceties for the benefit of his supporters and bang the drum of “America First”.  World leaders were braced for surprises when Trump made his UN debut last year, but he still managed to shock, using his speech to threaten to “totally destroy” North Korea. This time, his counterparts arrive in New York having had a year to work out how to manage their relations with him.  But that does not mean they can predict what he will do or say.  “Last year, there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what President Trump would be like – and what he would do and how to talk to him,” said Jon Alterman, a former senior state department official and now vice-president of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.  “I think a lot of leaders actually stayed away last year because they were afraid of getting caught between not wanting to offend President Trump, but not wanting to do anything with him that would get them in trouble with the voters at home. I think people have sort of figured out how to deal with that. I think they’ve figured out how to deal with the president.”",3,2018-09-23 23:33:27

In the early 1980s, some Labour councillors deliberately set council budgets in excess of the limits imposed by central government.  The tactic was condemned at the 1985 party conference, where then leader Neil Kinnock denounced “the grotesque chaos of a Labour council – a Labour council – hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers”.  His intervention was a key moment in the drive to break the far-left Militant group’s hold over parts of the party, which ended with the expulsion of figures including Liverpool council’s deputy leader Derek Hatton.",3,2018-09-23 23:33:30
4,80,"Drug producers are capitalising on the rise of vaping to sell a liquid form of “spice” – an illegal synthetic substance nicknamed “zombie” – to unwitting customers.  Suppliers of Kronic Juice, which is being shipped into the UK labelled as a harmless e-liquid, refuse to disclose the ingredients, referring only to a “patent pending flavour enhancer”. However, laboratory tests commissioned by the Observer found it to contain a strain of synthetic cannabis that was banned in 2016.  The same chemical, sprayed on to plant matter and smoked in cigarette papers, was one of the so-called “legal highs” that came to be known as the zombie drug.  The emergence of liquid spice is the latest chapter in a battle between law enforcement and manufacturers, which led to the introduction of a blanket ban under the Psychoactive Substances Act in 2016.  The new law removed spice from high-street shops, but the latest revelations have led to questions over what is being done to police the importation of the drug.  Users have said it is many times more potent than herbal cannabis and have reported suffering chest pains, seizures, memory loss and withdrawal. Some have bought Kronic Juice believing it to contain a legal dose of CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis extract that is reported to have a wide range of health benefits, including easing symptoms of depression and arthritis.  Todd Renje believed he had bought CBD, which he had vaped for the past three years to self-medicate anxiety, having “decided against pharmaceuticals”. The 37-year-old from the United States said: “It was probably within two or three days that I found myself waking up the next morning and vaping a little before work, then taking it to work with me and vaping all day.  “It got to the point where I’m literally vaping this Kronic Juice every 20 or 30 minutes, and if I don’t I get very nauseous, I start shaking, I get sweaty. It went on for months because I was scared to stop.”  When he quit cold turkey, he said he suffered violent withdrawal symptoms. “I went from Friday, Saturday and Sunday with no sleep,” he said. “Vomiting, shaking, sweating, just feeling absolutely miserable. Then I had a seizure. I couldn’t even tell you what happened, I just woke up at hospital.”  Others, however, were aware it contained a psychoactive ingredient. One, who asked not to be named, said: “I really wanted to like it because it’s cheaper than weed and has plausible deniability.” The 20-year-old said he stopped vaping after it made him feel “confused and anxious”. He added: “It was not what I would call a high.”  In the absence of any information from the suppliers, users have taken to online forums to question the drug’s contents. But now tests reveal that Kronic Juice, bought from the company’s website and shipped to London, contains a class-B drug. Known formally as 5F-CUMYL-PINACA, it is illegal to possess, supply or manufacture in the UK.  The National Crime Agency said that it worked to “disrupt the online supply of drugs to the UK” but added that synthetic cannabis was not a “key priority”.  Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it illustrated how “the drugs problem is growing and becoming more varied”. She said that increasing the number of border guards was key to tackling drug importation.  Neil Woods, a former undercover police officer who now campaigns for a regulated drug market with the group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, said the refusal to reveal its contents was “as despicable as you can get”. “But that’s going to happen with prohibition,” he added.  “The obvious answer is regulation. These people can get away with this because there is no regulation to control them.”  The company’s website, which had been operating since 2015, went offline last week, less than 24 hours after an email was sent detailing this newspaper’s finding.

8,84,"NHS England is to be taken to court by the UK’s equality watchdog for failing to offer fertility services to transgender patients.  The Equality and Human Rights Commission will launch a high-profile judicial review action, a legal manoeuvre that is likely to prove controversial at a time when the NHS is struggling to balance budgets and provide core services.  Last month the Observer reported that the commission had written to NHS England putting it on notice that it needed to offer fertility services to transgender patients before they underwent treatment for gender dysphoria, a process that normally results in a loss of fertility.  By extracting and storing eggs and sperm before they undergo gender reassignment, transgender people can choose to have their biological children delivered via surrogates later in life. However, many are keen to proceed with treatment when they are teenagers, and may not have the resources to pay for such fertility services. This, the commission argues, discriminates against transgender people, whom it says should be offered the services as a standard procedure.  NHS England maintains that it is not its responsibility to ensure that fertility treatment is available to all patients, including transgender people. Currently it falls to individual clinical commissioning groups – the bodies that buy services for patients – to decide whether to provide them on the NHS, but many choose not to do so for transgender patients, according to the commission.  After receiving NHS England’s response , the commission has said it will now start legal proceedings. It is understood that NHS England continues to argue that it is under no obligation to offer the service at a national level.  “We have received a comprehensive response from NHS England to our letter regarding the provision of fertility services for transgender patients before they undergo treatment for gender dysphoria,” said Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the commission.  “We are proceeding with our judicial review claim and will remain in discussions with NHS England about the need to ensure the transgender community can access health services free from discrimination, and that individuals do not have to choose between treatment for gender dysphoria and the chance to start a family.”  The commission argues that gender dysphoria falls within NHS England’s specialised commissioning remit, which ensures appropriate treatment is given to those with complex conditions.  The legal case is likely to shine a light on how a large increase in people requesting transitioning treatment is placing greater demands on the health service.  Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equalities, has launched an inquiry into what has driven a 4,400% increase in the number of girls being referred for transitioning treatment in the past decade. In 2009, 40 girls were referred by doctors for gender treatment. Last year the number had risen to 1,806.  The role of social media and the teaching of transgender issues in schools will form part of the inquiry.  A spokeswoman for NHS England said: “NHS England has responded in detail to the EHRC explaining why we believe their request is both misjudged and potentially unfair to NHS patients. If, however, they still decide to sue the NHS, the courts will consider the matter in the usual way.”",3,2018-09-23 23:33:54
9,85,"A rower has been rescued off the coast of Land’s End after attempting a solo trip across the Atlantic in a homemade boat.  Duncan Hutchison set off from New York in May on his 3,500-mile journey to Lochinver, north-west Scotland. He was carrying out the journey in a 23ft wooden rowing boat and has raised more than £18,000 for the charity WaterAid .  Hutchison was rescued 863 miles off the Cornish coast on Saturday by a merchant tanker that is now taking him back to New York.  A post on his Facebook page said: “He will be devastated, especially with a technical problem rather than a physical or structural issue of the boat.  “Although he’s totally dedicated to completing the challenge, today marked 100 days at sea. He’s acted responsibly in the best interests of support services, surrounding boats and himself. Calling this in was probably the toughest thing Duncan’s ever had to do, but is testament to his selfless and professional approach throughout the journey.”  The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Hutchison reported that he was in difficulties at about 1am and was “battling 2.5-metre waves”.  A spokesman said: “HM Coastguard broadcast alerts to vessels in the area and the man was picked up by a merchant tanker who diverted to the scene. His 23ft wooden rowing boat is now being towed by that vessel.”  Duty commander Mark Rodaway said Hutchison had been picked up and was safe and well. He said: “We’ll continue to keep in touch with him via the tanker crew while they progress their passage back towards New York.

11,87,"When the southern Italian city of Matera found out it had been selected as the 2019 European capital of culture , its ancient streets echoed with cheers. Thousands gathered in October 2014 to watch the announcement live from Brussels in a central piazza. “It reminded me of the day when Napoli announced it had acquired Diego Maradona,” said Daniele Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman who has invested in a hotel in Matera. “The same uproar was heard throughout the town.”  But the euphoria was quickly replaced by a sense of anxiety. “After the celebrations,” said Eustachio Nicoletti, Matera’s secretary for Italy’s largest labour union, the CGIL, “people began to wonder, ‘and what the hell are we going to do now?’”  Today, with little over three months remaining until 2019, that concern has become a real fear that the city’s big opportunity could instead be a colossal failure. Local organisations and business owners are warning that the city will simply not be ready. Rome and Brussels secured €400m (£360m) to organise the year’s events, money that was supposed to pay for restoring buildings and repairing streets in a place famed for its stunning but dilapidated beauty and history of dire poverty.  But, according to the unions, most of the money is still trapped in the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy and has not yet been spent.  “Of the seven buildings that should have housed the cultural events, at least five will not be ready in time for 2019,” said Nicoletti.   Interactive: map of Matera   Concern also surrounds accessibility: half of the funding, about €200m, had been allocated for the construction of a new railway line. The station is there – it was built in 1986 – but there is no railway. Matera can still be reached only by a slow, secondary rail line from Bari, which takes nearly two hours to cover 60km, while work to complete the Bradanica highway, connecting the city with the north of the Basilicata region , began almost 40 years ago and has yet to be completed.  “The truth is that the disregard for not meeting deadlines was already well known in 2014,” said Enzo Acito, former director of tourism for Matera. “Everyone knew that with the snail’s pace of Italian bureaucracy and the typical waiting times for the construction industry in Italy , the facilities would never be completed by 2019.”  Matera was the first southern Italian city to be recognised as a European capital of culture . But, like many towns across the region, it bears the wounds of structural deficiencies, such as high youth unemployment, alleged corruption and obscure political manoeuvrings. In July the president of the Basilicata region, Marcello Pittella, was placed under house arrest by prosecutors in Matera for alleged involvement in rigging healthcare contracts. He denies all the accusations against him.  Such problems, often chronic in the south of Italy, are exacerbated by historic and deeply rooted difficulties in a town which was virtually abandoned for more than 40 years after the second world war. Cut off from the modern economy, Matera was one of Europe’s poorest cities, where families lived in grottoes, the “Sassi” (literally stones) carved out of the limestone that dated back to Matera’s prehistoric era.",9,2018-09-23 23:34:08

The “full-on storm” suggests there’s more to this one than buying a leather jacket. Good news: all literature is your friend, one way and another.  The original literary midlife crisis is Dante: “In the middle of our journey of life, I came to myself, in a dark wood, where the direct way was lost...” Men have had a lot to say about midlife crises ever since. Martin Amis’s The Information (“Cities at night, I feel, contain men who cry in their sleep and then say nothing”) has a stab at all three of the categories I mention above.

16,92,"S paceflight will mark an important milestone this year – when Nasa celebrates the 50th anniversary of US astronauts reaching the moon. In December 1968 Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders – on Apollo 8 – swept over the lunar surface and captured bright blue images of Earth rising above the grey plains of the moon. It was one of the most dramatic space missions ever flown. Manned landings followed, but after a few years, the US lost interest in lunar space flights.  But now Nasa has revealed plans to return to the Moon and has asked European scientists and industry leaders to join the agency in a bold plan aimed at rebooting humanity’s conquest of the solar system - in the form of an international manned station that will orbit the moon within the next decade.  The proposed station, the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway – known as Gateway – will allow astronauts to develop techniques that will open up the lunar surface to exploration and exploitation. At the same time, the station will help humans hone survival skills in deep space in preparation for future manned missions to Mars, says Nasa.  Taking part in the station’s construction would cost Europe more than £1bn and a decision on whether to become involved will be taken at a meeting of European science ministers next year. If ministers give the go-ahead, the European Space Agency (Esa) – of which Britain is a key member – would then join other international partners that Nasa is recruiting to its Gateway project. These include the space agencies of Russia, Canada and Japan.  “Essentially, Gateway will be a robotic outpost that will be visited by groups of astronauts – initially for weeks and then for months at a time,” says David Parker, director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration for Esa and a keen supporter of the project. “They will learn how to survive in deep space and deal with problems such as radiation and meteorites. At the same time they will also direct robot craft that will explore the moon’s surface.”   The lunar rover's precision tools    A go-ahead for Gateway would also bring to an end the hiatus in manned space exploration that has lasted for almost a decade. Since the grounding of the space shuttle, human spaceflights have been restricted to launches of Russia’s Soyuz space capsule, which is used to ferry crew and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), and the few missions taken by taikonauts on China’s fledgling spacecraft.  Gateway should change that – and it will do so by taking advantage of a major advance in US space engineering which will occur when Nasa begins flights with its new deep-space capsule, Orion , and its launcher, the Space Launch System in a few years. These will form the core components of Gateway along with modules similar to those now used as stores and crew quarters on the ISS (see box), though Nasa stresses Gateway will be considerably smaller than their current Earth-orbiting space station.  And key to operation of their lunar station will be the extraction, from lunar soil, of minerals, chemicals, and – most important – water. “Recent evidence suggests comets and asteroids have bombarded the moon for billions of years, depositing water – in the form of ice – on to its polar regions,” said Mahesh Anand, reader in planetary science and exploration at the Open University.  Scientists like Anand believe it should be possible to use that water to turn the moon into a refuelling station for long-term missions to Mars and beyond. Ice would be harvested, melted and electrolysed – using power generated by solar panels – into its hydrogen and oxygen components. “You could then use that hydrogen and oxygen as liquid propellents,” added Anand. “That is what powered the space shuttle’s main engines after all. Then you could use the moon as a refuelling post to power spaceships to Mars.”  It remains a far-off goal. For a start, astronomers do not have precise details of the most promising places to find water on the moon. Finding those sources will not be easy, but not impossible – thanks to Gateway. It will orbit the moon from a height of a few hundred miles and from there astronauts will control robot rovers remotely and send them trundling over the lunar surface to pinpoint areas rich in water ice. Samples could even be sent back to the space station by unmanned spacecraft.  Scientists at Esa are already working with Canadian and Japanese space agencies to prepare a robot mission called Heracles, which would travel to the moon sometime in the next decade and which would use the Gateway as a halfway house to store lunar samples before being sent back to Earth. “It will be much easier to drive a robot rover from a height of only a few hundred miles above the moon than from the Earth which is 250,000 miles away,” says Anand. “It will take only a fraction of a second to send a signal and get a response. By contrast it would take several seconds if you are on Earth, making the control of a lunar rover much, much more difficult.”  European astronauts recently guided an automated rover on Earth using controls in the ISS – which orbits the Earth at roughly the same height that Gateway would orbit the moon. The technology is therefore already well tested, says Esa.  “The moon has lain virtually undisturbed for the last 4.5bn years,” says Parker. “It is a museum of the history of our solar system. And yes, we visited it when we briefly landed Apollo spacecraft there. However, that was the equivalent of going to a museum, heading straight to the gift shop and then leaving. It is the dusty corners of a museum where you find the really interesting stuff – and that is where we are going to go with Gateway.”  This point is backed by James Carpenter , a member of Esa’s lunar exploration team. “The major scientific impact of Gateway will undoubtedly come from the way it will open up access to the lunar surface,” he says. “However, there are many other areas of research that will benefit.",9,2018-09-23 23:34:32
17,93,"Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland’s first black professor, has welcomed a groundbreaking report into how Glasgow University benefited from the proceeds of slavery. He said it posed “uncomfortable questions” for British society as a whole and called on institutions that had profited from the slave trade to make amends.  The report , published last week by Glasgow University, is based on more than two years of research and reveals that the institution benefited directly from the slave trade in Africa and the Caribbean in the 18th and 19th centuries to the tune of almost £200m in today’s money.  The university has now launched a wide-ranging and ambitious “reparative justice programme”. Ironically, the university was at the forefront of the movement in the 19th century to abolish slavery. It will now create a centre for the study of slavery and a memorial or tribute in the name of the enslaved. It is also working to establish ties with the University of the West Indies.  The report’s findings, though, carry profound implications far beyond the cloistered spaces of this 546-year-old university. The unrelenting and forensic detail of the study also raises questions about how the wealth of the city of Glasgow and other parts of Scotland was derived.  “Some Scots have told me they’re mystified why no one told them any of this, but who did they think made the tobacco?” said Palmer, professor emeritus at the school of life sciences at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. “Now, I think the country faces a very uncomfortable question which the Glasgow University report has raised once more: to what extent did slavery make Scotland great?”",3,2018-09-23 23:34:35

19,95,"P olitics before the crash was based on the understanding that you couldn’t have it all. The free-market right had won the economic war, ran the cliche of the time, while the left had won the culture war. Centre-left governments were “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich”, said Peter Mandelson, “ as long as they pay their taxes ”. Not only leftish politicians, however, but many on the centre-right were not remotely relaxed about racism, sexism and homophobia. On these issues at least, cultural conservatives, as we so euphemistically call them, had to accept that the world had changed.  Now Britain is a country where political movements believe they need not accept any limits on their ambitions. They do not just want to beat their opponents – they want to crush them. They do not just want to win – they yearn for the religious ecstasy of victories achieved without compromise. It is barely noticed that centrists are just as likely as the extremists of the Brexit right and far left to turn into Cosmo girls and demand to have it all . The people’s vote movement believes, with ample reason, that the Leave campaign was a confederacy of charlatans that sold the public a pack of lies. Reasonably and patriotically, it is trying to protect the country by reversing the damage. It is not a criticism of an idea with which I have every sympathy to say that it has turned away from compromise.  After the referendum, there was talk of making the best of Brexit by campaigning to keep Britain in the single market and customs union . It would protect living standards and maintain peace in Ireland, while accepting some EU laws and freedom of movement in return.  The “ Norway option ” is what compromises are meant to be: a deal that fully satisfies no one. It might have won over tepid supporters of Leave, who were not prepared to have their futures sacrificed on the altar of British nationalism.",3,2018-09-23 23:34:45

22,98,"I love primary schools, art galleries and London, so it’s not surprising that the news that artist Steve McQueen is leading a team photographing every year 3 class in the city, with the results exhibited in Tate Britain next autumn, filled me with cheer. Never mind that neither of my daughters, nor any of the London children I know best, is the right age – you have to have an eighth birthday between this month and August 2019.  Year 3 is the exact middle of primary school, if you count from reception to year 6. With all the capital’s 2,410 primaries invited to take part, not just parents but anyone with an interest in the city’s future will surely be intrigued by McQueen’s answer to what he called the “quite urgent” question of who, in the year of Brexit, we are.  Like Michael Apted in his classic Up documentary series , which followed a group of children from seven on, McQueen is explicit about his wish to explore issues of identity. “When you first start education, things start to change. When you start being aware of gender, when you start being aware of race. When you start being aware of class … it can actually change your thoughts forever,” he said.

23,99,"Kanye West has tweeted a series of thoughts on social media and self-esteem, along with a screen grab of a conversation with Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, who agrees that it’s time to change a system that no longer works as it should or once did. “Social media can be good but we have to hold the heads responsible for the psychological damage it sometimes causes,” wrote West, linking to a video, posted to Instagram, of Denzel Washington saying that young people should turn off social media.  Perhaps as a test run for his promised 2024 US presidential bid, instead of simply observing the problem, West offered a solution: “We should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have. Just like how we can turn off the comments, we should be able to turn off the display of followers. This has an intense negative impact on our self-worth.” You could view that as someone with more than 28 million followers realising that it’s hard to have a proper conversation over a cacophony of bots, bros and snowflakes, but it sounds like the start of a sensible and practical discussion about change.  In the text conversation with West, Dorsey set out what Twitter should be aiming for. He said that the need for more followers skewed people’s incentives for tweeting. Certainly, it has made the public conversation more crude and more polarised and shown the potentially catastrophic effects of oversimplification. “We want to incentivise contribution to the global conversation and consciousness,” Dorsey explained. The idea that metrics be removed is a radical one, particularly if we take away all markers of impact and scale. It would replace pandering to an audience with a guessing game as to who’s listening: essentially, we’d all be shouting into the void, unsure of whether anyone is there or not. Would that produce some kind of Black Mirror hellhole or would it be a comparative utopia?  There are more and more reports of our growing lack of contentment and last week the Girlguiding organisation published a survey stating that the happiness of girls and young women is in sharp decline, in part, it is suggested, because they are outside less and online more. Life online, in its current state, is chipping away at everyone’s self-worth and the need for change is becoming urgent, wherever that change may come from.

24,100,"W hen secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced a few days ago that the Trump administration had set a ceiling of 30,000 refugees who could be resettled in the United States in the next year beginning 1 October, he ritually added: “We are and continue to be the most generous nation in the world.”  Not quite. Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has a population slightly more than one-tenth that of the United States – and an economy slightly less than one-tenth the size. Like the United States, Canada carefully screens applicants for admission as refugees and has had great success in integrating them into Canadian society. Canada is now taking in 27,000 refugees a year. To match Canada , the United States would have to accept about 250,000 refugees a year.  Many countries that are much closer to the places from which refugees are fleeing, and that do not have the luxury of having their consular services engage in rigorous, time consuming admissions processes, give refuge to vastly great numbers. Turkey has accommodated about 3.5 million Syrian refugees since 2011; and Lebanon and Jordan have taken in even larger numbers in proportion to their population.  Several Latin American countries are now taking in hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing repression and starvation. Impoverished Bangladesh is sheltering about 700,000 Rohingya who have fled genocidal violence in Myanmar during the past year. Though it has come at a high political cost for their governing coalitions, Sweden and Germany have led the way among western countries in recent years in demonstrating generosity to refugees.  Pompeo tried to bolster his case for American generosity by pointing out that the United States would also process some 280,000 asylum applications in the next year. He failed to mention, however, that the great majority of these would be denied. In recent years, the number of asylum applications in the United States that succeeded has been roughly between 20,000 and 25,000. That number is likely to go down.  Many asylum applicants are migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These are countries with extremely high murder rates due to gang violence that is, in part, a legacy of the wars in Central America of a generation ago. The Trump administration has made it clear to immigration judges – who are administrative employees of the United States Department of Justice – that it does not believe that escaping the gangs amounts to fleeing “a well-founded fear of persecution,” the legal standard for granting asylum.  The claim that the United States is very generous also seems based on the amount of foreign aid that is distributed. Though this is larger in absolute terms than the aid given by others, as a percentage of GDP, it is much lower than that of several other western countries.  Since 1975, the United States has accepted more than 3.3 million refugees for permanent resettlement, or close to 80,000 a year on average. The Trump administration reduced the ceiling to 45,000 for the current year. Though the final numbers are not yet in hand, the United States is on track for about half that. That suggests that next year’s refugee admissions could also be a lot lower than the 30,000 that has been announced. This appears a victory for administration hard line ethnic nationalists who sought a far lower figure.  According to the International Rescue Committee, those admitted in the current year which ends 30 September include only 60 Syrian refugees. Though the Trump administration has said it gives priority to persecuted religious minorities, only five Yazidis were admitted. Another category that is supposedly favored includes Iraqis who gave assistance to US missions in that country and who may subsequently be in danger. Only 48 of them were admitted this year.  Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is concerned about the global reputation of the United States. Yet many of its actions are producing resentment in different parts of the world. These include its trade war with China; its unilateral abrogation of the treaty to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons; its cessation of humanitarian support for Palestinian refugees; its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement; and its warm words for the leaders of authoritarian regimes that abuse human rights in such countries as Russia, Poland, Egypt, North Korea, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.  In previous periods, the United States also did many things that alienated people in many parts of the world. These were often offset, however, by policies and practices that reflected a generous spirit in dealing with the victims of natural disasters and man-made disasters in different parts of the globe. Unfortunately for the United States, the Trump administration does not seem to recognize that the country is better off in the world if its “America first” policy is balanced by a willingness to accept a reasonable share of responsibility for alleviating the distress of those unfortunates who have had to become refugees.",9,2018-09-23 23:35:04

At the close Wolves came close to stealing victory when David de Gea saved a shot from Adama Traoré with a foot and the winger then blasted wide in added time.  This left José Mourinho again bewailing his players’ mindset, stating those of Wolves possessed a “World Cup final” attitude and his did not.  “They play like I like to play, which is like the World Cup final,” the manager said. “That is the attitude I like my teams to have in every match.

If Charity Shield results are included, this is now the finest start to a campaign in Liverpool’s illustrious history.

29,105,"I t is the family stuff, the detail that would usually remain private, that provides some of the toughest passages from the newly released book Unspoken , in which the people who knew Gary Speed the best try to make sense out of a tragedy none of them will ever properly understand.  The story, for example, his widow, Louise, tells of the long, unimaginable battle to start functioning again and the shattering effects of what she describes, more than once, as being put on the scene of a horror film. It was Louise who found her husband in the garage, who had to cut him down and will always have to live with that image. “As time goes on,” she says, “you hope it’s a film that fades.” But there was also a long period when she could not even eat, when she drank to numb the pain and lost so much weight she describes herself as a walking skeleton.  It was one of her friends, Tracey, who convinced Louise she could face the world again, who turned up in the morning to force her to have breakfast, persuaded her to take the dog for a walk and got her back on her feet.  Over time, Louise kept a space on her kitchen wall where anyone who visited the house had to write an inspirational quote. She called it her wonder wall, just a tiny part in the healing process, but it was getting on for six months before she could contemplate going out. A friend had invited Louise to a party and nobody, perhaps, should be surprised that she found it such an ordeal. “I really didn’t feel right putting on a dress and going out. I was Louise Speed, wife of Gary Speed who had hung himself. How could you act normally?” Arriving at the party, the first song she heard was Simple Minds and Don’t You Forget About Me. It was her and Gary’s song.  These are personal details that I suspect would have remained that way had it not been for the bond between Speed and John Richardson, the football journalist who has written Unspoken , the proceeds of which include a donation on Louise’s behalf to the Heads Together charity , tackling mental health issues.  The two men knew each other through their different lines of work, one playing for Wales and the other covering them from the press box. They hit it off and I can still remember being in the pressroom at Bolton one day when he wandered in to catch up with his old mate. It was different to the usual player-journalist relationship. They were friends, genuine friends, and it stayed in my mind because it was unusual to see someone my side of the fence forge that kind of connection with a top-level player.",4,2018-09-23 23:35:23
30,106,"T he prospect of defeat simultaneously excites and frightens Anthony Joshua, as it does most boxers. But it is different for heavyweights, where uncertainty is built into every punch, and the unbeaten four-belt world champion knows that at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night Alexander Povetkin will provide the biggest threat to his dominance since Wladimir Klitschko knocked him down in the same ring 18 months ago.  The Ukrainian had not long turned 42, at the end of a decade of hegemony shared intermittently with his older brother, Vitali. Joshua’s Russian challenger is 39 and the champion, a mere 28, acknowledges he is “the second hardest” opponent of his career after Klitschko, the only fighter to beat Povetkin. There is much at stake. Joshua, whose last four fights have been in front of 300,000 fans in the nation’s two biggest football stadiums – numbers that were unimaginable for even the sport’s most decorated champions of the past – is the No 1 individual box-office draw in the history of British sport. Nobody comes close.  And he brings with him not only the belts sanctioned by the IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO but the expectations of millions that the gilded tale of the ever-smiling Olympic champion and reformed street kid from Watford will not end just yet. Ramping up his heartbeat will be the jangling nerves he needs to deliver on those hopes.  Joshua loves a thrill, from paragliding in Brazil, to scaling seaside cliffs with Bear Grylls, to the loud roar of motorbikes. “I remember growing up around the estate,” he says, “a couple of boys had, like, little quad bikes, 50cc. It was a buzz. I like bungee jumping, going around race tracks in cars, high-speed stuff. There was the hang glider in Rio. That was baaad!  “The buzz from boxing is so different. You think about the fear of losing more. When I’m on the bike I don’t think about the fear of falling off, it’s just speed, speed, speed. In boxing it’s not, like, go, go, go. It’s, like, I don’t want to make a mistake. I don’t want to fall off. It’s weird.  “That fear of losing is always there. Sugar Ray Robinson, the best fighter of all time, lost. Sugar Ray Leonard. Marvin Hagler. Thomas Hearns. Roberto Durán, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Riddick Bowe. What?  “People say, ‘He ain’t nothing like Riddick Bowe’. So who am I to go undefeated?

I remember getting lost in the fog, wandering around terrified and disoriented. Eventually I stumbled into a farm. They just put me in a Land Rover and delivered me home. That freedom’s been lost.

Giles My greatest vice is reading the Daily Mail . All the things I’m interested in are very Guardian , but it doesn’t quite get you going like the Mail does.  Mary Mick Jagger was the only person I’ve met who made me starstruck, but I was slightly drunk so I chatted to him anyway. Someone asked afterwards what I’d said and I couldn’t remember. They said: “I hope it wasn’t about the 60s. He gets furious if people talk about the 60s, as if that’s when he peaked and he’s done nothing since.” Then I realised that’s exactly what I’d talked about.  Giles My earliest memory is seeing the tassels on the pram hood, surrounded by high hedges in a garden in Sussex. It led me to a lifelong interest in hedges. I tell other people in the village not to cut their hedges too early because the nesting birds have second or third broods. Annoyingly, they tend to ignore my advice.  Mary: I’ve only ever committed white collar crimes: reused unfranked stamps or travelled without buying a ticket if the conductor didn’t come round. We know a man who commuted to London daily for 20 years and hid in the loo both ways. Life’s too short. Besides, my conscience would come after me. I’m too honest.  Giles: The last time I cried was a year ago at the death of our dearly beloved Tibetan spaniel. I was very brave to begin with and buried him in the garden, but later when I opened the fridge and saw his dog food, it hit me.  Mary The closest I’ve come to death was contracting Legionnaires’ disease in 1999. I caught it from air conditioning in the Bahamas and developed something called Beau’s lines: white ridges across the fingernails which are a sign that your body’s shutting down for death. It knocked the stuffing out of me. I’ve never been quite the same since.  Giles Fame hasn’t changed us. We fly under the radar. That changed a little bit when French and Saunders spoofed us, which was recognition that we’d seeped into the national consciousness.

42,118,"Michael Lewis began thinking about his new book,  The Fifth Risk , in late 2016 or early 2017 during the weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration. He was bedridden after surgery and was “laying there going crazy about Trump,” he recalls. Lewis had just published his latest bestseller, The Undoing Project , about two Israeli psychologists, the Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who studied how people grapple with risk. “One of the insights that dropped out of some of their experiments was: people don’t,” Lewis says. “When you change something that has a one in a million chance of happening to a one in ten thousand chance, people don’t feel that.”  One way to think about the US government, Lewis realised, was as a manager of big risks – from military conflict, to financial collapse, to natural disaster. As risk-manager-in-chief, Trump now had the frightening ability to boost the odds of catastrophe from, say, one in a million to one in ten thousand “over a vast portfolio of risks”. “People sense an unease,” Lewis continues, “but nobody quite puts it that way.”  Lewis was contemplating the nation’s dire risk portfolio when Trump tapped the former Texas governor Rick Perry to be secretary of the Department of Energy. Five years earlier, Perry had said in a presidential debate that he wanted to eliminate that cabinet-level department. At least, he had tried to say it: in a moment that helped sweep his ruinous candidacy into oblivion, Perry forgot the department’s name.  “It’s bad enough Rick Perry has no sense of this,” Lewis thought after hearing of his appointment. But he had to acknowledge he didn’t know anything about the department either. So he decided to find out. “It took about two phone calls before I learned, ‘Oh, that’s where the nuclear weapons are. Oh my God.’”  What Lewis went on to discover was even more shocking. On the morning after the presidential election, as the balloons from the previous night’s parties are still settling on the ballroom floors, the president-elect is expected to send teams into every department of the US federal government to begin the transition of power. But at the Department of Energy last November – and, it turned out, at many of the country’s 14 other federal departments – one day passed, and then another, and no one came.  Bureaucrats in the Obama administration had worked for a year to prepare thousands of pages of briefings on the risks their successors could face. Yet by Thanksgiving, no one from the Trump team had arrived to receive them. “I was fucking nervous … ,” Steve Bannon later told friends about Trump’s handling of the transition, Lewis reports in the book. “I go, ‘Holy fuck, this guy doesn’t know anything. And he doesn’t give a shit.’”  As Trump came to power, the department that manages one of civilisation’s most obvious existential risks was effectively going without leadership. So was the department that keeps millions of Americans from going hungry. And the one tracking the next superstorm. So Lewis decided to find out what was in the Obama briefings himself.  ¶  Risk – and the people who attempt, with arrogance or humility, for profit or disaster, to exploit it – has been the central theme of Lewis’s highly successful career. In his debut book, the 1989 memoir Liar’s Poker , he watched from his seat on the London trading floor as the investment bank Salomon Brothers turned Wall Street into what he later described as a black box of exotic risks that were poorly understood by investors and bankers alike.  Two decades later, in the highly leveraged mortgage-securities market that Salomon pioneered, the US’s largest banks were again mining profits in a mountain of complex risk. When the mine collapsed, the CEOs got massive paydays, and the rest of us got buried by the global financial crisis. A small handful of rogues who bet against the banks’ unsustainable risks also made tens of millions of dollars. In The Big Short – a book turned into an Oscar-winning film starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling – Lewis explored the disaster through their stories.",9,2018-09-23 23:36:15
43,119,"Y an Lianke published his first story in 1979 at the age of 21, and has gone on to produce a formidable body of work. Some of Yan’s novels have been banned in his native China for their satirical take on contemporary life, including his latest work, The Day the Sun Died , which had to be published first in Taiwan. The novel, about 14-year-old Li Niannian, who tries to save his fellow townsfolk from themselves during one dreadful night of “dream walking”, has been read in the west as a critique of Xi Jinping’s “Chinese dream” of national greatness. Yan has won the Man Asian literary prize and the Franz Kafka prize, has twice been shortlisted for the Man Booker international prize, and has been widely tipped for the Nobel. Born in Henan province, he lives in Beijing, where many of his novels are set.  What was the idea behind the novel? I had experienced some instances of sleepwalking myself, and I kept seeing reports on my phone of other people sleepwalking. The idea for the novel came from this. I wanted to write about people’s inner worlds, and how they might manifest themselves if they behaved according to their innermost, most secret, desires.  Why did you choose a 14-year-old narrator? A story like this has to have a certain element of randomness and unpredictability, and if a very switched-on adult was to narrate it, it would be much less believable. But by having an adolescent tell the story, one who isn’t very bright, it becomes much easier for people to believe.  If this novel is a critique of Chinese society, as many believe it to be, was it easier for you to write that kind of critique from the perspective of a more innocent, even rather foolish or simple, narrator? Yes, by choosing a very innocent, very pure voice, I did find it a good way to discuss things in China that are the most difficult, the most complex things to talk about, the deepest reaches of Chinese people’s hearts. And it was by looking at society through the eyes of such a person that I could describe people behaving in the most basic ways, often in very dark ways. But I could also emphasise the occasional blast of the very opposite of all of that, of great goodness.  British critics have read this novel not just as a social critique, but also as a political one, of Xi Jinping’s ‘Chinese dream’. The translator of the British edition , Carlos Rojas, suggests this, too, in his introduction. Did you intend it to be read this way? Actually, when I first read some of the comments by critics here I was really surprised, because that hadn’t been particularly my original intention. I wanted merely, through writing about sleepwalking, to reflect a lot of basic and fundamental truths about the human heart. A direct connection to the Chinese dream was not what I intended at all. It would actually have been rather dangerous for me to go around writing a critique of it – and far too simplistic. My idea had been to use sleepwalking to explore what happens when people have the chance to do the things that they are always thinking about, but which in “real life” are absolutely impossible to do, whether they are evil things or good. It’s about longings that are being repressed.  Part of the nightmare in the novel is that you yourself can no longer write. Why did you put yourself into the story, and does it reflect your greatest fear as an author? I have that feeling quite often on completion of a novel – that for the next 10 years I’ll never be able to write another book! So the inability to write is always a great fear, I always feel great anxiety about not being able to write again.  Do you feel it a burden, to be one of the most renowned chroniclers of contemporary China? It’s complicated, because the situation for writers in China is complex, and not necessarily because of censorship. It is true that I have been finding it hard to get my books published in China. But actually that doesn’t matter because, if you don’t have a publisher, you can write whatever you like – and that is a kind of release, a kind of freedom. Actually, writers are restrained by the publishing world – you have to fit in with what they require and if you can’t do that, you won’t get published.",10,2018-09-23 23:36:18
44,120,"Rihanna has been given an ambassadorial role in her native Barbados .  The singer and entrepreneur will promote education, tourism and investment in her home country.  Rihanna said she was proud to receive the prestigious title and was looking forward to helping “reimagine Barbados”.  As well as her multi-platinum record sales, the 30-year-old singer was hailed for her “significant creative acumen and shrewdness in business” by the Caribbean island’s prime minister, Mia Amor Mottley.  Mottley said: “Rihanna has a deep love for this country and this is reflected in her philanthropy, especially in the areas of health and education. She also shows her patriotism in the way she gives back to this country and continues to treasure the island as her home.”  Already a cultural ambassador for Barbados, Rihanna’s expanded role reflects her “global influence across a much broader range of areas”. Motley also noted her significant charitable contributions at home and abroad.  “I couldn’t be more proud to take on such a prestigious title in my home country,” Rihanna said. “Every Barbadian is going to have to play their role in this current effort, and I’m ready and excited to take on the responsibility.  “I look forward to working with Prime Minister Mottley and her team to reimagine Barbados.”",3,2018-09-23 23:36:26

47,123,"It has all the offerings of a typical drinks festival: beer on tap, live music, cocktail masterclasses and competitions to find the best bartender. But the mindful drinking festival coming to Glasgow next month is missing one key ingredient: alcohol.  Billed as Scotland’s first alcohol-free drinks festival, the event is organised by Club Soda , a mindful drinking movement with 23,000 members across the UK, and aims to meet growing demand from pubs and bars keen to learn more about alternatives amid rising concern about the health risks of alcohol abuse.  “Glasgow recognises itself as a hard-drinking city, and I get the impression that, collectively, people know this is something it needs,” says Laura Willoughby, campaigner and co-founder of Club Soda. It will be the first time the movement has held a festival outside London.  Willoughby says prominent public health campaigns, as well as strict drink-driving laws and a vocal debate about Scotland’s alcohol problems, have fuelled a change in attitudes. “Our members in Scotland are far more willing to talk about it because there doesn’t seem to be the stigma around changing your drinking that there is in England,” she says.  Despite 21% of Scots declaring themselves teetotal in 2017, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) , alcohol consumption in Scotland remains high. A report by NHS Health Scotland found that enough alcohol had been sold in Scotland in 2017 for every adult to exceed the official guidelines by 40% every week of the year. Focused efforts by the Scottish government, including minimum alcohol unit pricing, which came into force in May, have aimed to tackle this.  Dr Eric Carlin, director of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems , welcomes the move to challenge the entrenched notion that socialising and drinking must go hand in hand.  “One of the things we’ve found talking to people is that often they’re quite embarrassed about saying they’re not drinking,” he says. “We thoroughly support any move that would make it normal to be out having a good time without alcohol being a part of it all the time.”  This is something Rhona Burton, 28, from Glasgow can relate to. After suffering from crippling anxiety following a period of heavy drinking, she decided to cut back on alcohol and has now quit altogether. “Not drinking still holds connotations of being no craic,” she says. “I personally waited so long because I was worried what people would think of me.”  So is there a new generation of Scots shunning alcohol? “Young people are drinking less than they ever have been in Scotland,” says Carlin. “However, the ones who are drinking are probably drinking a lot more than used to be the case, so there’s a need for targeted action.”  According to the ONS release on adult drinking habits in Great Britain, Scots report drinking less overall than in England, but have higher rates of binge-drinking.  Carlin also stresses the importance of addressing drinking among older people, particularly in middle age. “That’s the group which is drinking the most in Scotland, and suffering the most harm as a result,” he says.  In a bid to reach this audience, the mindful drinking festival will run workshops and talks in collaboration with Drink Wise Age Well , a Glasgow-based campaign aimed at helping people make healthier alcohol choices as they age.  Both Willoughby and Carlin believe accessibility to alternative drinks is key to aiding healthier choices. Low-alcohol and no-alcohol offerings have seen fast-growing consumer interest. According to figures from Kantar Worldpanel, sales of beer and cider with less than 1.2% alcohol grew by nearly 30% last year compared with 2015.  BrewDog, a craft brewer based in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, reported a 53.5% rise in sales of its 0.5% beer Nanny State in Scotland in 2017.  “I still think Scotland has a long way to go with drinking, as you are trying to retrain a culture,” says Rhona Burton. “But I think bringing a cool status to sobriety would help us rethink.”  A Scottish Government spokesperson said:  “It’s no secret Scotland has a troubled relationship with alcohol, with nearly 700 hospital admissions and an average of 22 deaths per week from alcohol misuse.  “A key milestone in tackling this was the introduction of minimum unit pricing earlier this year, which will save lives, reduce hospital admissions and, ultimately, have positive impacts across our communities.  “Ventures such as the Mindful Drinking Festival are always welcome, providing as they do, a friendly, sociable space for people to have a good time while enjoying an alternative to alcoholic drinks.”",3,2018-09-23 23:36:56
48,124,"W e moved around a bit when I was a child so it’s hard to tell what made me. My dad was a teacher in tiny rural primary schools, at first in Herefordshire, close to the Welsh border. Beautiful places that gave me a sense of the romantic, of being an outsider, or at least that I was always an observer looking in. It’s hard to be the headmaster’s kid in a school of 30 pupils, most of whom have grown up together. I remember it as a time of solitary wandering, watching and listening, but perhaps that’s a romantic idea too. I often featured in my own stories.  When I was 11 we landed up in north Devon. I’d moved to the grammar school in Barnstaple and for the first time made real friends. Looking back, I remember the summers, family days on the beach, picnics and space.

49,125,"I t has been more than a year since the operation, but Alistair is still furious about the results. “I paid £8,000 and they mutilated me,” he says. “It was butchery. My partner said it looked like a war wound. My erection is basically ruined.”  In July 2017, the 55-year-old decorator, from London, became one of a growing number of British men to have a surgical penis enlargement. Talk of enhancement was once the preserve of promotional spam mail for bizarre-looking pills and pumps; now, it is serious clinical business. British clinics, which have taken consultancy rooms in Harley Street and in UK cities including Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham and Leeds, report record numbers of patients calling on their services. One practice, the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery, has gone from performing a handful of penis procedures annually when it opened in 1990 to more than 250 in 2017. Between 2013 and 2017, members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery carried out 45,604 penis enhancements worldwide. Previous numbers are unknown; the procedure was considered such a minority concern that it wasn’t included in surveys. This increase in demand seemingly caters to a growing anxiety about penis size, but it is by no means a risk-free procedure. For Alistair, dreams of a larger penis were overtaken by infections, lumps and an erection that no longer rises above a 45-degree angle. And he is not alone. In recent years, the General Medical Council has recorded stories of “wonky penises” and erectile dysfunction following surgery. In Stockholm, last summer, a 30-year-old man died after suffering a cardiac arrest following an operation to enlarge his penis.  ***  At his Harley Street clinic, Dr Roberto Viel is explaining how a typical enlargement works. First, surgeons sever the organ’s suspensory ligament, causing it to hang an inch or two lower, giving the impression of extra length. They then extract fat from the patient’s stomach and inject it into the penis shaft, increasing girth by around two inches. Erect, it’s worth noting, it remains roughly the same size, suggesting the motives for many men are not necessarily to enhance either their – or a partner’s – sexual experience.  The procedure, which can cost more than £5,000, lasts a little over an hour, but causes enough residual discomfort that doctors recommend patients take a week off work. The penis remains bandaged for 10 days. Sex is off the cards for a month. Erection suppressants are prescribed to avoid stitches being ripped open.  “Operations are very safe,” says Viel, who founded the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery with his twin brother Maurizio. “Perhaps 95% of our patients are very happy. Where they are not, it is often to do with expectations. Some men want 10 inches when nature gave them four or five. I have to say, gently, ‘This is not possible. I am not a miracle worker.’”",3,2018-09-23 23:37:11
50,126,"Zwift began as a virtual cycling idea: video graphics programmer and amateur triathlete Jon Mayfield invented it after the birth of his first child, his PR told me, “when he found himself very time poor”. Training on an exercise bike is famously boring, so Mayfield added a gaming element, connected all the time-poor cyclist fathers across the world on the internet, and lo… one in India could race another in Australia up a virtual Alpine mountain. And pretty soon, Zwift cyclists were logging a million miles a day, which makes me wonder what the time-poor new mothers thought of it.  The running version is very new, requires less tech (you don’t need a bespoke static bike) but is not without its complications. You need a Bluetooth footpod (I had a Stryd , which costs just over £220, although cheaper options are available), and a not inconsiderable IQ to figure out how to attach it to your trainers. Obviously, you need to be on a treadmill. You download the app on to your phone, though an iPad is better for the virtual scenery. To set it up, you need to teach it your pace by doing some test running. All told, it’s probably the hardest I’ve had to concentrate since I did my A-levels, but you only have to do it once.  I’m not a fan of computer-generated scenery. It doesn’t lift my spirits. If I see a mountain, I’m only thinking of the incline and the pain. Fake snow doesn’t help.

Ardnish is a small uninhabited peninsula – uninhabited perhaps for the first time in millennia, for there are mysterious pre-Roman vitrified forts on an offshore island and the footprints of boathouses for Viking longboats. Most conspicuously, though, the shores are fringed with a succession of abandoned crofting villages.

57,133,"Labour would fight a snap general election vowing to press ahead with Brexit, but it would secure better terms, John McDonnell has said, defying demands from party members to include a second-referendum pledge in any manifesto.  The standoff between Theresa May and the EU27 leaders in Salzburg this week, and the apparent lack of a parliamentary majority for her Chequers plan for Brexit , have raised the possibility of an early general election.  Labour has repeatedly made clear that it would prefer this option over a “people’s vote” on any deal.   Graphic: how would Labour members vote on EU membership today?   The shadow chancellor also suggested on Saturday that the rail industry could be renationalised within five years under a Labour government.  He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it would be possible to bring all franchises back under public control during a single term in office, amid reports he is planning a public ownership unit within the Treasury to deal with renationalisations.  Earlier, speaking as Labour prepares to gather in Liverpool for its annual conference, with Brexit high on the agenda, the shadow chancellor told the Guardian he would expect his party’s stance to be similar to the one it took in 2017.  “We would be in the same situation there, where we would be saying: we’re accepting that original vote; this is the sort of deal that we want,” McDonnell said.  “I really think people want this sorted. That means negotiating a deal that will meet people’s objectives. So you don’t get hung up on the semantics; you do the deal that will protect their jobs, and address some of the concerns that they had during the referendum.”  He underlined his scepticism about the idea of a vote on the final deal, which will be discussed in Liverpool after more than a hundred constituency Labour parties, and the Labour-supporting unions, called for it to be put on the agenda.  “The debate around the next manifesto will go on, but I really worry about another referendum,” he said.  “I’m desperately trying to avoid any rise of xenophobia that happened last time around; I’m desperately trying to avoid giving any opportunity to Ukip or the far right. I think there’s the real risk of that. We’re not ruling out a people’s vote, but there’s a real risk, and I think people need to take that into account when we’re arguing for one.”  Much of Labour’s manifesto, if there was a snap poll, would probably be based on last year’s document, The Many, Not the Few, drafted by Corbyn’s policy chief, Andrew Fisher. But the final version would have to be approved by a committee of senior party figures at a so-called clause V meeting – and would be expected to take party conference resolutions into account.  Advocates of a people’s vote would like to see Labour shift its position decisively towards advocating a poll on whatever deal is struck with Brussels.  But McDonnell’s words echoed those of Corbyn, who told BBC Scotland on Thursday, when he was asked whether Brexit should go ahead: “The referendum made that decision.”  Labour is keen not to be blown off course by Brexit, and hopes instead to use its conference to show that it is preparing for government, and translating last year’s popular manifesto into concrete policies.  McDonnell told the Guardian he would set up a public ownership unit inside the Treasury, allowing him to personally oversee one of Labour’s most transformative economic policies: the nationalisation of public utilities.  Labour has said it will bring water, rail and the Royal Mail back into public ownership and examine whether private finance initiative (PFI) contracts can be brought back on to the Treasury’s books.  McDonnell would direct the unit to examine whether consumers, workers and the local community could take on part-ownership and it would be overseen by a public and community ownership advisory board, made up of trade unions, business leaders and civil society members.  McDonnell said: “The reason for being transparent about how we’re doing it is to reassure people, this is the mechanism we’re going to use to do it. We’ll bring the expertise in, we’ll work up as much as we possibly can before we go into government, but these are the papers that we’ll give the civil servants in the run-up to the election.”  McDonnell has been holding regular meetings with City figures in a bid to convince them Labour’s economic policies should not be cause for alarm. He was cheered by a recent article by former Tory minister and Goldman Sachs economist Lord O’Neill saying the party had “stepped into the vacuum left by the government and appears to be offering the radical change that people seek”.  And McDonnell is acutely conscious that Labour would be unlikely to be given much of a honeymoon by instinctively sceptical financial markets, so it would have to move rapidly to convince voters it could make their lives better.  “I’ve been saying to Jeremy and the others, the first Queen’s speech has got to be incredibly popular. It’s got to change people’s lives, quickly and effectively, so that means putting money back in people’s pockets through the real living wage, rolling out the investment quickly. And the public ownership alongside that will assist us, because it will mean that we’re not wasting resources on profiteers.”  Corbyn’s longtime political ally has adopted a markedly higher profile in recent months, in particular since the antisemitism row that preoccupied senior Labour figures for much of the summer.  “It was horrible and it was heart-rending,” he says now. “I had no summer at all, but we came out of it. As soon as we get back into the swing of things, we just want to get out there, get the policies out there, and get round as much media as we can.”  The charm offensive has reignited speculation that he covets the leadership for himself, if Corbyn decided to step aside – or he could even elbow his old ally aside. But asked if he wants to be Labour leader, he says: “No, no, no, no, no. And as I said the other day, the next leader’s going to have to be a woman.  “Every year, it’s a hardy perennial, it’s either I’m plotting or I’m holding Jeremy Corbyn hostage so he won’t resign. We’ve worked together nearly 40 years. You can’t get much greater in terms of solidarity and loyalty between us. We’re mates, we’re close friends, we agree. We have disagreements on tactics, on minor things, but we resolve it in private by the end of the day.”",9,2018-09-23 23:38:06

59,135,"Owners of flats in a Manchester complex which was marketed as an “outstanding” investment opportunity are facing huge losses after the fire brigade banned people from living there.  The first residents moved into New Lawrence House in 2009 but were forced to move out the week after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 after serious safety faults were identified.  According to allegations in a high court claim, the faults included missing balconies that meant french windows opened on a drop to the ground, a lack of fire-stopping to prevent the spread of smoke and flames, and inadequate smoke ventilation to escape stairs and lift lobbies. The claimants are seeking £16m in compensation.  Among the alleged breaches of building regulations at the property, which is now empty, was a steel structure that was not treated with flame retardant; fire engineers said this left the five-storey building vulnerable to collapse in the event of a blaze. Three of the lifts were missing, the roof decking was collapsing and balconies were not strong enough to support people, according to the claim, which details more than 200 faults.  “There were french windows but if you stepped out you would fall straight down,” said Fazle Syed, who bought a flat at New Lawrence House for his family. “I thought it was so bad that we decided not to live here. I paid £137,000 for this. It is disgusting. It is just devastating for my family. We have lost whatever we had and because there is a mortgage of £90,000 we are still paying that.”  The case is set to be tried next month and comes amid growing fears about standards of residential construction in recent years as developers sought to attract foreign investment in rising UK property markets.  Buyers on developments in Bradford, Leicester, Birmingham, Rotherham and Liverpool have engaged lawyers after buildings were defective or never built. Thousands of people could be affected, according to Martin Scott, a lawyer representing claimants.

The bags – a stronger version of the biodegradable bags the convenience chain has been trialling since 2014 – will be rolled out within weeks to almost 1,400 stores across England, Scotland and Wales, and then to all 2,600 shops.  The change will start in towns, cities and villages where the bags are accepted in councils’ food waste collections, and the phased rollout will replace an estimated 60m plastic single-use carrier bags of the sort that have become an environmental scourge. The new-style bags will cost 5p, but shoppers also have the choice of plastic 10p “bags for life” and £1 heavy-duty turquoise Co-op carriers.  The move is part of a broader ethical strategy to be launched by the Co-op next week, tackling plastic pollution as well as covering food waste, healthy eating, saving energy and Fairtrade products. The Co-op says it will ban single-use own-brand plastic products and reduce its overall use of plastic packaging within five years, and stop using hard-to-recycle materials such as black plastic.  “The price of food wrapped in plastic has become too much to swallow and, from today, the Co-op will phase out any packaging which cannot be reused,” said Jo Whitfield, retail chief executive of the Co-op. “The first step to remove single-use plastic will be to launch compostable carrier bags in our stores. They are a simple but ingenious way to provide an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic shopping bags.”  The supermarket’s pledge on plastic will see all its own-brand packaging become easy to recycle by 2023. It has promised to use a minimum of 50% recycled plastic in bottles, pots, trays and punnets by 2021.  However on Friday Lidl UK stole a march and said it would remove black plastic from its entire fruit and vegetable range by the end of the month, becoming the first UK supermarket to do so. It also plans to remove black plastic from its fresh meat, fish and poultry range by August next year.  Meanwhile, Asda revealed that it is “nearly halfway” towards meeting its 10% plastic reduction target, which it first unveiled in February this year.

63,139,"A woman at the centre of a bizarre fresh nerve agent scare in Salisbury has denied that it was an elaborate hoax.  Russian-born model Anna Shapiro claimed on Friday that she really did fear her husband, Alex King, had been poisoned at an Italian restaurant in Salisbury.  She also appeared to stick by the story – which she told the Sun newspaper in vivid detail – that she was targeted by Russians.  Wiltshire police have been investigating the curious incident that resulted in streets being cordoned off and experts in protective suits tending to Shapiro, King and other people who were in the Prezzo restaurant on Sunday evening.  Medics were quickly able to rule out that there had been another nerve agent attack six months after the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, collapsed in the city.  There then followed speculation that the incident may have been a hoax and Wiltshire police have interviewed Shapiro, 30, and King, 42 .  On Friday evening, Shapiro’s lawyer, James Mullion, of Janes Solicitors, said: “There has been some media speculation that our client may have participated in an elaborate hoax as regards her fear of her husband’s poisoning at Prezzo restaurant on Sunday and its possible cause.  “She has asked Janes Solicitors to emphasise that she was not involved in any hoax and that her fears were genuine both as to the poisoning and her suspicion of foul play.  “However, as the incident is now being investigated by Wiltshire police, it is not appropriate to comment further at this stage. We ask the media respect our client’s privacy whilst she recovers from her ordeal.”  The incident was a further blow to Salisbury, which has been struggling to recover from the attack on the Skripals and the subsequent nerve agent poisonings of a local couple, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess.  In a front-page story published in the Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Shapiro claimed she and her husband had been targeted by Moscow.  The Sun reported that King was in a life-threatening condition and suggested he may have been poisoned with strychnine. By Wednesday evening, however, the story began to unravel when Salisbury district hospital released a statement saying both patients involved in the incident had been discharged and police sources said officers were looking into the possibility that the incident was a hoax.  The Sun’s original story about Shapiro’s claims was unavailable on its website by Thursday morning. A message said this was “for legal reasons”. The newspaper has refused to say whether it paid Shapiro for the story.  Shapiro and King are friends of Edward Davenport, nicknamed “Fast Eddy”, who is famed for throwing parties at a central London mansion attended by rock stars and film actors – and for being jailed for fraud . King used to act as Davenport’s “press representative” .  Davenport described King as a “fun guy” and told how in 2006 King won a £100,000 bet to get into a royal premiere and shake hands with Prince Charles. The Telegraph described King then as a “prankster” .  Meanwhile, Prezzo has re-opened. A spokesperson said on Friday: “We are delighted to have our Salisbury restaurant returned to us and to be back serving the Salisbury community and visitors.  “Our team have been both brave and resilient and we are extremely proud of how they handled the very difficult and completely unexpected situation in which they found themselves.  “We would also like to thank the emergency services who attended on the evening in question and our wonderful neighbours in Salisbury, who literally opened their doors to customers and staff caught up in the events of Sunday night.  “As you will understand we will not speculate any further on the individuals involved. This is now a matter between them and the police.”  A Wiltshire police spokesperson said: “We can confirm that both people have been interviewed and our inquiries are ongoing. We would ask the media not to speculate whilst these inquiries are ongoing.” No arrests have been made.",3,2018-09-23 23:38:50

66,142,"The Vatican and China said yesterday they had signed a historic agreement on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops, a breakthrough on an issue that for decades fuelled tensions between the Holy See and Beijing and thwarted efforts toward diplomatic relations.  The provisional agreement, which was signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was described by the Vatican as “the fruit of a gradual and reciprocal rapprochement”, following a long process of careful negotiation, and subject to periodic review.  “It concerns the nomination of bishops, a question of great importance for the life of the church, and creates the conditions for greater collaboration,” the Vatican said.  In Beijing, the foreign ministry put out a statement saying: “China and the Vatican will continue to maintain communications and push forward the process of improving relations between the two sides.”  But the deal was denounced by critics as a sellout to the communist government. “They’re [sending] the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It’s an incredible betrayal,” Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former archbishop of Hong Kong who has led the opposition to the deal , told Reuters.",3,2018-09-23 23:39:12
67,143,"Grieving families were on Sunday preparing to bury victims of Tanzania’s devastating ferry disaster, with more than 200 confirmed dead after the crowded boat capsized in Lake Victoria.  Hopes were fading of finding any more survivors three days after the ferry sank, even after rescuers pulled out an engineer who had managed to find refuge in an air pocket in the upturned vessel. The Tanzanian broadcasting corporation reported he had shut himself in the engine room.  “We are going to start burying bodies not yet identified by relatives,” said John Mongella, governor of Mwanza region, where the MV Nyerere ferry had been coming in to dock on the island of Ukara.  “The (burial) ceremony will be overseen by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, in the presence of clergy members of different denominations,” Mongella Told TBC 1 public television.  Mongella said 218 people had been confirmed dead, while 41 escaped the tragedy with their lives – a total figure far above the official capacity of the boat, which was in theory only able to carry 101 passengers.  Transport Minister Isack Kamwelwe said on Saturday that 172 of the victim’s bodies had been identified by relatives.  Navy divers resumed the search operation inside the sunken MV Nyerere early on Saturday after hearing sounds that suggested signs of life. They pulled a man out of the overturned ship and he was taken to hospital, a witness said, while bodies continued to float to the surface around the vessel. Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, has ordered the arrest of the managers of the ferry, which may have been carrying as many as 300 people when it capsized near the dock on the Ukara Island. The precise number was unknown, however, because the ticket-seller had drowned and the machine recording sales had not been found. During a speech on public television on Friday night, Magufuli referred to negligence and said he had ordered the arrest of all those involved in the management of the ferry. “It appears clear that the ferry was overloaded,” he said, adding that the arrests had already begun. The president also declared four days of national mourning. The works, transport and communication minister, Isack Kamwelwe, said the government was sending sophisticated equipment to aid the rescue. “This equipment will increase efficiency in the rescue operation and we will continue with the search until we are satisfied that we have rescued everyone,” he told Reuters. At least 40 people were brought to safety on Thursday as dozens of security forces and volunteers wearing gloves and face masks spent the day hauling bodies into wooden boats. Tanzanian ferries often carry hundreds of passengers and are overcrowded, and there are shifts in weight as passengers move to disembark. The Nyerere was crowded because it was a market day.  Domina Maua, who was among those at the dockside seeking information about survivors on Friday, said she had not heard from either her father or her younger brother who were on the ferry on a trip to buy a school uniform and other supplies for the new school term. The son of Davita Ngenda, an older woman in Ukara, was among the dead. “He had gone with his wife but she has not been found yet. My God, what did I do to deserve this?” she said. The ageing ferry, of which the hull and propellers were all that remained visible, was also carrying cargo, including sacks of maize, bananas and cement, when it capsized about 50 metres from Ukara dock. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but overloading is frequently to blame for such incidents. The country’s opposition, however, accused the government of negligence. “We have often raised concerns about the poor condition of this ferry, but the government turned a deaf ear. We have repeatedly denounced this negligence,” said John Mnyika, the deputy secretary general of Chadema, the main opposition party. Mnyika said overloading was “another failure of the authorities” and criticised “inadequate relief efforts as well as delays” in the rescue operation. With a surface area of 70,000 sq km (27,000 sq miles), the oval-shaped Lake Victoria is shared by Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Capsizes are not uncommon and the number of deaths is often high because of a shortage of lifejackets and the fact that many people in the region cannot swim.  The deadliest such incident in recent decades was in May 1996, when about 800 people died after their ferry sank on the way to Mwanza in Tanzania. Lake Victoria’s waters can be rough and boats are frequently poorly maintained, while ferry operators often fail to record the number of passengers on board.  About 20 people were killed in December 2016 when a boat overturned on the lake as it was carrying passengers to mainland Uganda for the Christmas holidays.  In March 2012, only two survivors were found after a boat carrying about 60 people capsized on the lake in Uganda.",3,2018-09-23 23:39:21

69,145,"E urope’s largest port, Rotterdam, is counting down to Brexit. “In about 200 days’ time, if nothing else happens… we will need to supervise all the goods coming in and out of the UK market,” says Roel van ’t Veld, Brexit coordinator at the Dutch customs authority.  Hard Brexit or soft? Chequers dead or alive ? Does “max-fac” make any sense? The feverish debate in Westminster is distant for officials in Rotterdam, who are working on the assumption the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union on 29 March 2019.  At the stroke of midnight, the UK will become another country to its EU neighbours. Rotterdam will have to run checks on 10,500 newly “foreign” boats. Officials expect a 30% increase in import inspections and a 100% increase in export inspections. Ferry operators warn of form-filling and delays. While a transition period could delay those changes until 2021, nothing is being taken for granted.  Companies are “spoiled” by the ease of trading within the EU’s internal market, van ’t Veld says. Take a Dutch company that makes ready meals for British consumers. Today it needs only a contract with a shop. In future, companies on both sides of the North Sea would need production location registration, an export declaration, exit and entry declarations and more.  “Instead of two pieces of documentation you would need nine additional documents,” says van ’t Veld, based on his reading of the UK customs bill. “In 200 days’ time, you cannot just send a ship , and if you don’t anticipate those changes, ships will not get through the gates.” (Since he spoke this month, more days have slipped by.)  The Netherlands will be one of the EU countries hardest hit by Brexit. Even under the “best-case” scenario of an EU free-trade agreement with the UK, it would lose 0.9% of annual economic output, worth €450 (£400) per person by 2030, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.  And when Brexit hurts, Rotterdam will feel the first pinch. Spread over a 25-mile-long area, the city supports 180,000 jobs and 3.5% of Dutch economic output. To prepare for Brexit, 928 extra customs officials and 145 veterinary inspectors are being hired, following a recommendation from the Dutch parliament.  Pieter Omtzigt, a Christian Democrat MP, who co-drafted the parliament’s report on Brexit, describes his message to the government: “Be prepared. Because Great Britain is running so late that you may run into trouble because there hasn’t been time to prepare things. This is a way too serious scenario.”  He would prefer Dutch public money were spent on 1,000 new teachers or nurses, he tells the Observer , but feels his country has no choice. “If, like the Netherlands, you earn more than half your money with trade, you understand that if the UK leaves the customs union, the work for customs and excise increases significantly. The Netherlands simply cannot afford a disrupted customs system.”",3,2018-09-23 23:39:35

74,150,"During his time with the publication, MacAskill has been chief political correspondent, diplomatic editor, Washington bureau chief, New York-based reporter, and defence and intelligence correspondent, as well as part of the Guardian team who won a Pulitzer Prize for our coverage of the Edward Snowden story.  When did you decide to become a journalist?  The catalyst was a school trip to the Scottish Daily Express, based in Glasgow. The deputy chief sub-editor showing us around was obviously well-liked and there was a lot of banter between him and other journalists and with the printers. That was it for me. I never wanted to be anything else. That deputy chief sub eventually ended up at the Guardian, Ian Jack. And so, happily, did I.  How did you come to the Guardian?  I was on the Glasgow Herald and the Scotsman and had a couple of stints working overseas. I was interviewed by then editor Alan Rusbridger in 1996. The interview went badly - neither of us is particularly loquacious and there were a lot of awkward silences - but he gave me the job anyway.  Do you remember your first day on the Guardian and how it felt to be here?  I was taken on as chief political correspondent. I had been in Northern Ireland for a few days for the Scotsman covering an outbreak of trouble. I flew back to London for a lunch at the Guardian office for the then Labour leader Tony Blair. I immediately liked the general lack of deference shown towards Blair. That set the tone for the next 22 years. We cannot be flattered, bullied or pressured.  In the run-up to the war in Iraq in 2003, I was writing the splash. Blair and Bush had met in the Azores for a final mini-summit ahead of the invasion. I can’t remember the intro now but it was something like UK and US on verge of war. Alastair Campbell phoned and asked what I was doing. So I told him. He said that is not the story: it should be Blair secures Bush pledge on Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I told him I was not writing that. Ten minutes later, the deputy editor Paul Johnson came to see me and said Campbell had phoned the editor to complain I had the wrong intro and it should be Israel-Palestine. Paul asked where the reference to Israel-Palestine was. I said paragraph four. He said: “Make it paragraph 18.” That is the attitude I liked.  Did the Guardian live up to expectations?  Yes. Kath Viner joined a few months after me and rose to become editor-in-chief. I stayed as a reporter but I think I got the better deal. Reporters have more fun.  You started out at Westminster – what was that like?  The Guardian office in parliament was a happy one. Then political editor Mike White and sketch-writer Simon Hoggart bickered like brothers but were funny with it. Around six o’clock, one of us would bring in a tray of drinks and we would sit drinking beer or wine as we wrote. I doubt if the political team still does that but who knows?  I was involved in the story that saw the first resignation from the Labour government, Peter Mandelson, forced out of the cabinet over a hidden mortgage deal. I had gone with colleague David Hencke, who found the story, to meet the source in a greasy-spoon cafe near Westminster. We have never disclosed the source. The identity is as interesting as the story itself.  What stories had the biggest impact on you?  After Westminster, I was on the foreign team for 14 years, travelling all over the world. I covered various conflicts but the one that had the most impact was Israel-Palestine. I have not been back in over a decade but it is still vivid. I interviewed Yasser Arafat, the leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Israeli soldiers, settlers and the victims of violence.  One of the reasons the Guardian gained popularity in the US was its opposition to the Iraq war. How did you come to write about that?  Deputy editor Paul Johnson, who has, by a long way, the best news sense of anyone I have worked with, was sceptical about the case for war with Iraq from early on and threw lots of reporters at it, including me. I went to Iraq several times before and after the invasion.  Tell us about covering Obama’s two White House elections.  I arrived in the US early in 2007 and one of the first things I did was to go to Iowa to see Hillary Clinton speak. She was favourite to secure the Democratic nomination for the White House race but I was disappointed: she was all platitudes and cliches. When I saw Obama speak for the first time, I thought he could win, even though he was 30 points behind her.  What have you done since you came back to the UK?  I have had a varied beat. I did defence. And spies. I was part of the team which covered the Scottish independence referendum. It was great to see so many people engaged in and passionate about politics. I found the same engagement and passion when covering Corbyn’s leadership campaign.  Your biggest story was meeting National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong in 2013. What was the most memorable moment?  The first time I met him. Holed up in a hotel room, his behaviour seemed odd at first. He had cushions lining the door to prevent eavesdropping. He placed a soya sauce bottle on top of absorbent paper and left it behind the door when he went out: if there was a spill, he would know someone had been in. He pulled a red hood over himself and his computer to protect his password. But he was the real deal, a genuine whistleblower. With the US intelligence hunting for him, he had good reason for being paranoid.  What else stands out from that time?  Then US editor Janine Gibson showed courage in publishing the first of the stories. On a conference call, they tried to flatter her with an invitation to the White House. They tried to intimidate her. She told them she was going ahead with publication.  What was it like to be played in a Hollywood film, Snowden?  It was nice to be portrayed by Tom Wilkinson. But it never felt like me. He refers to Ed as ”‘laddie”. I have never called anyone “laddie” in my life.  Are there any stories you wish you’d written?  Simon Goodley’s undercover reporting exposing working conditions at Sports Direct. That is what the Guardian is all about.  What have been your biggest mistakes?  The stories I knew about but did not write. Confessing to them all would make foreign and home desks cringe. But here is one: one of Gaddafi’s sons hinted to me a few days in advance Libya was going to get rid of all its weapons of mass destruction. It sounded implausible. I could not find a source to back it up so did not write it. When the Libyan government made the announcement – it was December 2003 - it was big news all around the world, a genuine surprise to most people. Unfortunately not to me.  Why did Donald Trump call you a “nasty, nasty guy”?  It was at a press conference in Scotland in 2016. I challenged him over his claim of popularity in the UK. I told him he was toxic in Britain. I was banned from his next press conference.  What advice would you have for young journalists starting out?  They do not need advice from me. I recently taught young journalists from around the world. One of them had covered the fall of Aleppo. Another had revealed a huge medical scandal in Africa.  What has been the Guardian’s greatest moments during your time here?  Alan looks benign but he took on every part of the establishment and presided over a great run of stories: WikiLeaks, phone-hacking and Snowden. Since Kath took over, the stories have kept on coming: Milly Gentleman on immigration; Carole Cadwalladr on Cambridge Analytica; Juliette Garside and her team on the Panama and Paradise Papers; and Martin Chulov on Islamic State.  What have you been proudest of?  One of the best things about the Guardian is the morning conference. Unlike other news organisations, it is open to all staff, everyone free to speak. It is part post-mortem, part a look forward. Sometimes passionate. Occasionally heated. At its best, it throws up good story ideas. Over the last few weeks, knowing I was leaving, I have looked around at the faces, thinking ‘I am so glad I was part of this. I am glad I was one of you’. There has never been a day I was not proud to be part of the Guardian.",3,2018-09-23 23:39:58

It has been claimed for years that pollution caused by motor vehicles, especially diesel cars, buses and lorries, is a killer, with talk of tens of thousands of premature deaths . But the number was always abstract, the identities of the dead unknown. Now, for the first time, campaigners have the name of a young victim they say died as a direct result of air pollution: Ella Roberta Kissi-Debrah, Rosamund’s daughter, and if they can prove it they believe an invisible killer will become all too real.  Ella, who suffered from severe asthma, died in 2013 at the age of nine . She had been suffering asthma-related seizures like the one which killed her for three years.

78,154,"A s the Bible tells it, David committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband. “But it didn’t mean he wasn’t a good warrior or a good king,” says Nancy Allen. “The Bible says love covers all sin: love of God, love of country, love of children, love of grandchildren covers all the imperfections.”  And love, Allen says, underpins the presidency of Donald Trump and explains why she supports him despite his three marriages, adulterous affairs and frequent insult-laden diatribes. “When he got out of New York, he fell in love with the people. That’s why he holds these rallies. He’s the people’s president. He loves the country and he loves the American people who work hard and have been overlooked for years. The insiders in Washington forgot about us.”  Allen, 71, was attending the 13th annual Values Voter Summit at a luxury hotel in Washington DC on Friday. A procession of speakers championed Trump’s achievements in advancing the conservative agenda over the past 20 months and whipped up hostility towards Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Some also spoke in defence of his supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who has almost been derailed by allegations of sexual assault from when he was 17.    Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning   The president’s grip on the evangelical movement looked as solid as ever. He dips into a deep well of grievance: criticism of him in the media only appears to strengthen him among groups who complain that they, too, are persecuted by the urban elites. Their consciences have found their own way of coming to terms with the seemingly glaring contradiction between their strict moral principles and Trump’s private life, often by reaching for biblical terms such as forgiveness and redemption.  Like many at the conference, Allen was initially a supporter of Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primary but, when the Texas senator was beaten into second place, she threw in her lot with Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton. “We had one choice if we wanted our country back: Trump or Hillary. I believe God put him in that position because he’s so tough. He has an amazing energy and determination. The amazing thing about Trump is that he doesn’t get rattled. The more the fake news does, the more energised he becomes.”  But what about Trump’s chequered past – the affairs, the lies, the boast about grabbing women’s private parts? Allen, from Shelby, North Carolina, replied: “I believe he’s changed. In the campaign, he started to surround himself with godly men and women. If he did those things, it would bother me but he is what we need at such a time as this. We don’t need a pansy. We need someone strong.”  She also expressed support for Kavanaugh , whose confirmation hangs in the balance after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault at a party in 1982 when they were in high school and she was 15, he 17. Kavanaugh denies the allegations. Trump made the baseless claim on Twitter on Friday that if the attack “was as bad as she says”, charges would have been immediately filed.",3,2018-09-23 23:40:15

The judge spent five minutes trying to separate Son Of Rest and Baron Bolt, who finished four lengths in front of their 23 opponents, before declaring the first dead heat in the history of a race that was first staged in 1804.  Bookies and punters alike were waiting with bated breath for the result, as Son Of Rest had set off as the 5-1 favourite following a major gamble in the minutes leading up to the race.  The reason was obvious: Fozzy Stack’s four-year-old had finished second in a Group One sprint in Ireland seven days earlier and was set to race off a mark of 101 at Ayr.  When Son Of Rest charged into the lead a furlong out, it seemed the gamble was about to be landed. That race was over five furlongs, however, and Son Of Rest was running on empty in the final strides, having covered an extra furlong on heavy ground.

In an interview with the Observer , Watson says that with the likelihood of a general election growing after Theresa May’s humiliation at the EU summit in Salzburg last week, it is vital the Labour leadership and membership unite to maximise the chance of dislodging the Tories from office.  Watson says that while he would prefer Brexit to be debated in an election soon, he is clear that the views of the membership in favour of another public vote must be respected.  “Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members,” he says. “So if the people’s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it.” He added: “That is what happens when you return the party to the members.”  Asked if this should mean Labour commits to another national vote in its next election manifesto, he said: “There is going to be pressure in the system for that to happen.”  Watson’s willingness to support a second referendum contrasts with the more cautious approach of Corbyn and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell , and sets the stage for a potentially explosive debate on Brexit in Liverpool on Tuesday.",9,2018-09-23 23:41:23

The news that the prime minister’s team was planning a hastily arranged statement in Downing Street was the final straw for some, who had palpitations about the prospect of another election. “The thought of another Theresa May manifesto is enough to make anyone reach for the bottle,” said a former minister.  The outbreak of fear and loathing was the direct result of a disastrous diplomatic week for the prime minister, during which her Chequers Brexit proposals were rejected in brusque, politically brutal style at a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg .  By adopting a similarly combative tone in her Friday statement hitting back at Brussels, she has made the task of securing a deal even more difficult, some of her ministers fear. One senior minister said: “It would seem she is gambling all by [rejecting the options on the table], but urging once again the bespoke deal for the UK or bust.”  So how did it come to this? Just a day earlier, things had seemed relatively calm. On Thursday morning the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, described May’s address to leaders at the previous evening’s dinner as polite. A meeting between May and the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, in Salzburg’s Sheraton Grand hotel was said to be non-confrontational. Meanwhile, in Dublin, David Lidington, the cool-headed cabinet office minister, was having a good meeting with the Irish Brexit minister, Simon Coveney.  But appearances can be deceptive. In truth, the seeds of the Salzburg crisis had already been sown at the leaders’ dinner the previous evening.  Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, after a lengthy and inconclusive debate over migration, May gave her eight-minute address on the state of the Brexit talks. It was listened to in silence. But the gathered leaders and diplomats had their thoughts, even if they were not sharing them. May had brought her domestic politics to the table. “Did she want to hear about everyone else’s domestic problems?” asked one person present.  The prime minister had read from her op-ed that morning in the German newspaper Die Welt in which she warned that the EU would have to change course. And she had repeated a mantra on Chequers that is an anathema to the EU: take it or leave it. Over the following 24 hours, after further missteps, including further prevarication over the crucial, knotty issue of the Irish border, the answer from the bloc could not have been clearer. They were not taking it. Just in case the message hadn’t been received, a photograph was posted on Donald Tusk’s Instagram account of the European council president offering May some cake. “A piece of cake, perhaps?” it read. “Sorry, no cherries.”",3,2018-09-23 23:41:27

The vultures had been circling after three defeats and the historians leafing all the way back to the spring of 2004, the last time they lost four consecutive games in a single season. Mauricio Pochettino needed his players to stand tall at what has become one of the Premier League’s more testing venues for the bigger clubs; they did that and, while this performance fell some way short of their fluent best, a few suggestions of a return to form flickered, too.  Foremost among them was their second, ultimately decisive goal, scored by Érik Lamela after the kind of rapier-like attack Tottenham have made their trademark under Pochettino. Lamela had replaced Son Heung-min eight minutes before taking possession just inside the Brighton half and, via Lucas Moura, working the ball to Danny Rose. He kept running and was rewarded with an accurate cutback that, without breaking stride, he swept beyond Mat Ryan.",9,2018-09-23 23:41:34

A large peace banner is unfurled and raised to waist height. Each person touches it, as if the sign, to establish their territory as an internationally protected “humanitarian zone”, is sacred.  A solemn blessing is read and repeated: a memorial to those who have been “disappeared”, murdered, silenced and displaced; those whose names they know, those they don’t.  “For the four men who disappeared on the river Naya in April,” says one woman. “For my brothers,” says Siode Arbolia, 35, tears welling up. Her young brothers, Elcias and Didier Arboleda, were among five people from Carrá, a neighbouring village, shot dead near their homes in March 2017 by an armed group.   Interactive: map of Valle del Cauca   The banner, placed overlooking the river at the village entrance, is a statement of sorts: it shows outsiders that the community has the backing of the international NGO Christian Aid , as well as the Inter-church Commission on Justice and Peace (CIJP), and that its leaders have denounced any collaboration with armed groups.  The San Juan and Naya rivers are two of Colombia’s main drug-trafficking routes and the communities are surrounded by armed groups vying for control of their land. Flowing more or less parallel to each other, on either side of Buenaventura , the country’s main port, the rivers carry shipments of cocaine from fields and laboratories deep in the jungle to the Pacific coast, where they are dispatched to international markets, including the US and Europe.  Earlier this year European officials warned that the rising availability of the illegal drug on the streets of the continent was a result of increased production in Colombia. New data shows coca cultivation had surged to a record high; the amount of land used to harvest the coca plant soared by 17% in 2017 in comparison with the previous year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

97,869,"Theresa May is being warned by cabinet colleagues that a shift towards a harder Brexit will hasten the break-up of the UK, amid a renewed attempt by Brexiters to secure a clean split from the European Union .  With senior Tories warning that the prime minister now risks a diplomatic calamity on the scale of the Suez crisis, following her disastrous Salzburg summit , she is facing a renewed campaign among ministers and influential backbenchers to ditch her current plans and back a looser free trade deal with the EU.  However, some cabinet ministers are concerned such a shift will effectively place a border between Northern Ireland and Britain and put it “in the departure lounge from the UK”. Cabinet sources are also warning that such a move would reignite the debate about Scotland’s place in the UK and further unravel the union. “Nobody voted Brexit to break up the UK,” one minister said. Another said: “Those advocating [the free trade deal] approach need to face up to the consequences for the union.”  Some Tory aides are said to be so worried about the lack of support for May’s current Brexit plans that they fear another snap election will be needed before the end of the year. Downing Street sources categorically denied that such an option was being considered in No 10.  Last night, May again attempted to calm the warring factions in her party, calling for “cool heads”.  “It is time to hold our nerve,” she said. “I have said many times that these negotiations would be tough, and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.” She also accused Labour, Lib Dem and SNP figures of “actively undermining the UK’s negotiating position” in their talks with the EU.  May’s diplomatic miscalculation last week led senior Tories to compare it to the Suez crisis , the foreign policy blunder of 1956 that destroyed Anthony Eden’s premiership. A major Tory donor said: “This will accelerate business concern even further. This ends up with us suffering a series of quite cataclysmic events.  “It is like the Suez crisis. You just don’t know what the unintended consequences will be. The next three weeks could change everything. The Suez crisis went on for months and this is up there with some of the great turning points in British political history.”  Since May’s Chequers deal was rejected in humiliating fashion by EU leaders last week , momentum has been building once again among some Tories behind the idea of securing a free trade deal, similar to that given to Canada . A report by the Institute of Economic Affairs backing such an idea will be launched on Monday and is expected to receive significant support from Tory MPs. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, yesterday refused to rule out pursuing a Canada-style deal, but warned it would not solve the Irish border issue.  On Saturday, Nigel Farage and David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, both took part in a rally in Bolton calling for May to “chuck Chequers”. Davis said: “If you think you can bully this country, you really should read some history books.”  While cabinet ministers continue to back the Chequers proposals in public, many acknowledge that they would have to be seriously reworked to have any hope of being backed by Brussels. Even then, it is not clear that a majority of MPs will back such an outcome.  Those in cabinet advocating a shift towards a Canada-style deal believe it would not lead to a border in the Irish Sea. They predict that with an acceptable Brexit deal in the offing, the EU will agree to soften its line on border checks. “This is the way we have to go,” said a source.  The Tory turmoil has led Labour to hope that an election may be the ultimate outcome. However, pro-Remain Tory MPs warned Labour that while they would never vote to topple the government, they might be persuaded to back a second referendum on Brexit should Labour support one.  Guto Bebb, the former Tory defence minister, said: “Conservative MPs will not vote to bring down a Conservative government. For the Labour leadership to continue peddling the myth that they will is frankly bizarre. If there is a Brexit deal and the government cannot secure support in parliament, the options will then be crashing out with no deal – which nobody voted for – or putting the matter back to the public through a people’s vote .”  Anna Soubry, another Tory Remainer, said: “If, as seems likely, parliament becomes gridlocked over Brexit, the only credible way out that I can see will be a people’s vote. The idea that Conservative MPs would instead vote with Labour to bring down the government is a fantasy.”  Tory MP Heidi Allen said: “It’s not just Conservative MPs who wouldn’t support calls for a general election, a significant number of Labour MPs wouldn’t, either.”",3,2018-09-23 23:42:02

99,902,"The troubled retailer House of Fraser is to shut three stores and is considering the closure of a fourth after its new owner, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley, failed to agree terms with their landlords.  Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United Football Club, recently bought the department store chain out of administration for £90m. Following negotiations with landlords around Britain, 20 House of Frasers have so far been saved from closure, safeguarding around 3,500 jobs.  However, Ashley told the Press Association he had been unable to save outlets in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon after failing to agree terms.  Hundreds of staff employed at the three stores will now go through redundancy consultation.  A fourth House of Fraser, in Bath, is also at risk of closure as Ashley negotiates with the city council, the store’s landlord, over new rental terms.  It is understood that the landlords were reluctant to agree to the low – or in some cases zero – rents that Ashley was demanding. “I am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable,” he said.  Ashley, who has pledged to save around 47 of House of Fraser’s 59 outlets since buying the chain, recently struck a deal to save its flagship Oxford Street store.  Others that have been saved from closure include stores in Altrincham, Aylesbury, Camberley, Carlisle, Darlington, Doncaster, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Lincoln, Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Skipton, Telford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Maidstone, Solihull and Sutton Coldfield.  “We’ve shown what we can achieve on the British high street when we work together with landlords,” said Ashley. “I would like to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date.”  Another store to be rescued is in Birkenhead, the constituency of veteran MP Frank Field, who described the news as “tremendous”.  “This cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again,” he said.",3,2018-09-23 23:42:08

The door is opened by Miriam, Faithfull’s twentysomething helper who comes every morning, staying until 6pm (she’s an aspiring film-maker, and killer coffee-maker). Books teeter everywhere in piles, on the floor next to shelves, and all over the dining table. An orchid also flowers opulently on it (stolen from a hotel room by Faithfull’s friend, Roger Waters), and a framed letter from Faithfull’s father stands next to it. It was sent just after the publication of her 1994 memoir. “It was a strange wartime marriage of two people that produced you, darling,” it goes. “I feel proud, not only of your achievement in making a successful career, but of your success in growing into such a nice and mature person. Lots of love, your Dad.”  A voice to raise terror, full of rattle and coal dust, suddenly roars down the hall. “MIRIAM!” A few minutes later, Marianne Faithfull appears – but she’s not terrifying at all. Her smile beams as she hobbles slowly; she smiles almost constantly today, despite being in obvious pain. She fell and broke her back in 2013, then fell and broke her hip the following summer. Its replacement was done badly, leading to an infection around the prosthesis. Her shoulder requires an operation this autumn, then there’s the arthritis in her left arm and hand – her writing hand.  “It’s literally a pain to fucking do anything,” she says, settling in her seat with Miriam’s help. She’s brought a fan, plus a plate of mango, cut into tiny pieces, which she lifts to her mouth to reach the final bits (“excuse me for being disgusting”). She then smokes a cigarette slowly: she started again a few years ago. “It’s the last thing I do. I don’t even drink coffee any more!” She sighs, theatrically. “Everything fucking hurts. But you try and fucking stop me.”  We’re here to talk about Faithfull’s 21st solo album, which has a fantastic title: Negative Capability , a Keatsian concept Faithfull learned about in her teens. “It’s about looking at something from all sides, from all points of view, knowing that everything is equally valuable, and that some mysteries can’t be pinned down to fact and reason. It’s fabulous.” Faithfull, at 71, looks equally fabulous on its cover – her short, shaggy blond hair styled just so, her walking stick held unapologetically in her right hand.",9,2018-09-23 23:42:28

As followers of the show, watched by 11 million viewers, wait to find out who is unmasked as the villain on Sunday night in a final 75-minute episode, former Metropolitan police commander David Zinzan told the Observer he wanted to reassure the public that corruption was not widespread.  “It’s true that a television series can influence people’s perceptions. I would like to hope the audience will see the bigger picture though,” said Zinzan, who served on an anti-corruption squad in the Met. “I wouldn’t want them to think most cops are corrupt. I came across a small number of officers and it was sad to see even that. You always get a few who are, but that is probably true in any profession.”  Zinzan spent 30 years at Scotland Yard working on counter-terrorism, homicide, serious and organised crime, as well as on anti-corruption, and also served as deputy chief constable of Devon and Cornwall. “I have also worked at a senior level with colleagues from security services, and I found them to be very professional and straight,” he said. “In my view it is healthy that in this country the BBC is allowed to make a programme that questions the integrity of these organisations.”  Zinzan worked closely with the show’s creator, Jed Mercurio , and has also advised on seasons three and four of the writer’s acclaimed police drama, Line of Duty , as well as on its fifth season, now being filmed.",3,2018-09-23 23:42:33

113,916,"In medieval English folklore, the lord of misrule was an anarchic, half-crazed clown who presided over an annual Feast of Fools. This week the UN security council, that most august and sober of international bodies, looks set to revive the tradition with its own riotous diplomatic banquet. In the chair and wielding the gavel for the first time : none other than Donald Trump, 45th US president, former reality TV host, and modern-day lord of misrule.  Trump will be in New York for the annual UN general assembly of world leaders. Some 84 heads of state, 44 heads of government and senior ministers from the UN’s 193 sovereign states are due to attend. Like other presidents and premiers, Trump will address the assembly on Tuesday. Last year he stole the show when he tore up protocol, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, and mocked its leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” – before performing a dizzying U-turn this year.  Although the UN gathering will discuss a range of worthy subjects , including poverty and climate change, drug trafficking and gender equality, all eyes will inevitably be on Trump’s antics. The White House has already indicated that his main target on Tuesday will be Iran. Trump will accuse Tehran, in trademark confrontational terms, of supporting terrorism, lying about nuclear weapons, and fomenting regional instability.  But it is the unprecedented spectacle of Trump chairing a security council session, scheduled for the following day, that could attract most attention. Since he apparently believes he is the No 1 world leader, here is his chance to prove it.  Iran will again top the agenda – because the country whose turn it is to chair the council, in this case the US, chooses what it debates. Trump is expected to try to browbeat members into backing swingeing new US sanctions on Tehran.  And that’s when the trouble could start. All the other permanent members of the council – China, Russia, the UK and France – have deplored Trump’s decision to withdraw from the UN-endorsed, multilateral nuclear pact with Iran. The EU and others are working to minimise the impact of sanctions. They all believe it is better to engage with Iran rather than ostracise it, and despite denials, they all suspect Trump’s ultimate aim is regime change. US officials, fearing a major embarrassment, have already broadened the council’s agenda to encompass nuclear proliferation in general. But if Trump resorts to the disrespectful language, blatant untruths and bullying that have come to characterise his presidency, he may provoke a powerful backlash.  Far from supporting his claim to global leadership, the ensuing row could starkly dramatise American isolation. And that would hand a victory to Iran . It is even possible that Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, who is attending the general assembly, could come to the security council to defend his country. That is unlikely, but Rouhani is not one to duck a fight. At last year’s assembly he roundly denounced Trump as a “rogue newcomer” peddling “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric”. It was America’s president, not Iran, who threatened world peace, he said.  Trump’s performance this week will raise bigger questions about his administration’s negative approach to multilateralism and international law, and his rocky relationship with the UN itself. Speaking to the American media outlet Politico last week , a senior German diplomat said preserving the Iran nuclear deal had become a “question of principle”, concerning the need to maintain international norms, treaties and agreements. Reflecting these worries, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, called on Thursday for “renewed commitment to a rules-based global order”.  Speaking against a backdrop of criticism of the UN’s failure to halt the Syria conflict, scandals over sexual harassment and gender inequality, and funding problems, a defensive-sounding Guterres warned that “multilateralism is under attack from many different directions precisely when we need it most”. The UN, he declared, was still “the world’s indispensable forum for international cooperation”.  Trump’s willingness to exploit the UN platform for his own ends, while simultaneously denigrating and undermining it, contrasts unhappily with the historical US approach to an organisation Franklin Roosevelt was instrumental in creating in 1945. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn from the UN’s human rights council and Unesco, its education and cultural agency; cut funding for peacekeeping operations, the UN population fund and Palestinian relief agency; and boycotted the UN’s Paris climate change accord, the Iran deal, and the global migration pact.  Earlier this month, John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser , set out plans to destroy the UN-mandated International Criminal Court, the criminal justice system’s global flagship for prosecuting genocide and war crimes. Trump, meanwhile, continues his predecessors’ practice of failing to fully pay America’s UN dues. Although the US remains the biggest contributor, its budget arrears are estimated at $1.3bn.  Trump’s contemptuous treatment of the UN sets a demoralising example for less powerful countries that value it for the voice it gives them in world affairs. It is also exacerbating a negative trend among leaders of the great powers: a tendency to bypass an often deadlocked UN over the big geopolitical questions of the day (such as Iraq and Syria). The leaders of China, Russia and India will not be in New York this week. While Trump acts out and plays the fool, they will be busy taking responsibility for global leadership off America’s hands.",9,2018-09-23 23:43:33

115,1025,"Plans for a new levy on tens of thousands of second homes have been drawn up by Labour in a move designed to ease the housing crisis and generate funds to cut homelessness.  Second properties used as holiday homes would be the target of an annual tax should Labour win the next election, with each property facing an average levy of about £3,000 a year. It is the latest sign that Labour is prepared to back radical policies to show it is preparing for government and willing to target new taxes on wealth. The move could hit as many as 174,000 properties in England and raise up to £560m a year.  Labour has earmarked the money to battle homelessness, particularly the growing number of children living in temporary accommodation. Recent figures show that there are more than 120,000 children homeless in this type of emergency housing – up two-thirds since 2010.  The new levy would be based on a property’s council tax band, and represent a doubling of its council tax bill. The extra money would be sent to the Treasury rather than kept by councils.  It would only be applicable to second homes primarily used as holiday houses, and would not include homes that are rented or used for employment, or static caravans. Areas that would be affected include Cornwall, north Norfolk and parts of the Lake District. However, the policy will provoke claims that it would rely on second homeowners being honest about the use of their property. It could also be complicated to collect the money.  John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said the tax was needed to raise funds for a homelessness crisis that “shames us all”.  “Over the last eight years, the government has turned its back on the scandal of poor housing and homelessness,” he said. “A housing market that works for the many, needs government action to ensure everyone has a place to call home.  “As part of the next Labour government’s plan to rebuild Britain, we will introduce a levy on second homes used as holiday homes, to help homeless families. Labour will act to put a brake on the growing gap between Britain’s housing ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’.”  The party said that second home-ownership is at the heart of widening wealth inequality. Research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank recently found that nine in 10 additional property owners are in the top half of the wealth distribution.  In a report last year, it said there had been a 30% increase between 2000-02 and 2012-14 in the proportion of adults that owns multiple properties, rising 1.6 million to 5.2 million people.  Meanwhile, home ownership has fallen among the young. The chances of a young adult on a middle income owning a home in the UK have more than halved in the past two decades, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. For 25- to 34-year-olds earning between £22,200 and £30,600 per year, home ownership fell to just 27% in 2016 from 65% two decades ago.  All parties have vowed to tackle the housing crisis, with the government passing legislation earlier this year to allow councils to charge double the rate of council tax on homes left empty for years. Derek Thomas, the Tory MP for St Ives, said in a speech in June that he wanted to see “an additional council tax premium of up to an additional 100% from second homes”.  Healey said: “Tonight, more than 120,000 children will go to sleep in temporary hostel-type rooms, some sharing toilets or bathrooms with people they don’t know. These are the kids that can’t go home, whose family is homeless for want of decent, affordable housing. And to our national shame, their numbers have increased every year since 2010. At the other end of the housing market, thousands of properties are owned as second homes, either for investment or for holidays and weekend breaks.  “The housing crisis is part of a crisis of inequality – a market in which the housing wealth divides have widened following the global financial collapse a decade ago, as homeownership has continued to rise for the richest 10% and fallen for the least wealthy half of the population.”",9,2018-09-23 23:43:52
116,1026,"Katie Hopkins is due to address an extreme rightwing party on Sunday alongside speakers that include a Holocaust denier and a controversial US anti-Muslim campaigner who is banned from entering the UK.  The former reality-TV star is due to appear at the conference of For Britain, a party founded by the former Ukip leadership contender and anti-Muslim activist Anne Marie Waters .  Hopkins, who has promoted her appearance as “standing up for Britain”, is joined by guest speakers who include Ingrid Carlqvist, a Swedish anti-Muslim writer who has engaged in Holocaust denial, and the well-known Islamophobe Robert Spencer, who will address the audience via a video link after being barred from entering the UK by the Home Office in 2013.  Hopkins is also set to speak at the annual conference of the far-right Traditional Britain Group (TBG) in October. The TBG is a party run by the former Tory fringe figure Gregory Lauder-Frost, who has talked of deporting people who are not white to their “natural homelands”. The TBG has promoted its speakers as “guaranteeing a rousing and stimulating conference, filled with great insights from first-class people”.  According to leaked documents obtained by the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate , internal polling of For Britain’s members reveals that nearly half support a ban on people coming to the UK from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Somalia.  Hopkins, who recently applied for an insolvency agreement to avoid bankruptcy after a costly libel case involving the food writer Jack Monroe, works for Rebel Media, the Canadian far-right firm that has employed the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.  Robinson, currently courted by Ukip leader Gerard Batten , will appear in court for the retrial of a contempt of court charge on Thursday.",3,2018-09-23 23:43:56
117,1027,"Health visitors are struggling to care for families properly because they have “dangerously high” workloads in which some are looking after as many as 829 children, a study shows.  Falling numbers of health visitors mean that in most parts of England they are now looking after more – often many more – under-fives than the recommended maximum 250.  The findings have prompted warnings that health visitors are so busy that they may fail to spot child abuse, domestic violence and postnatal depression and have too little time to help mothers bond with their babies.  Health visitors are nurses or midwives who have switched roles to focus on supporting families with young children. Ministers have praised their work as “absolutely crucial” in ensuring babies and infants get a healthy start in life and they undertake a series of important checks before and after childbirth.  However, research by Dave Munday, a health official with the union Unite, has found that health visitors in the London borough of Hounslow have average caseloads of 829 children under five – the highest in England. Similarly, those in Luton and Peterborough are each looking after 756 children of that age, while in Croydon, south London, it is 591.  Those are far above the 250 children per health visitor limit that the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association, a part of Unite, and the Institute of Health Visiting both say is the maximum caseload if care is to be safe and of a high quality.  “These findings are very worrying”, said Munday, who obtained the data under freedom of information laws. Since 2015, local councils have commissioned health visiting services, but most pay NHS trusts to carry out the work. It should be a “significant concern” that only 18 of the 132 providers that supplied figures had average caseloads under 250, while in 18 others caseloads involved 500 or more children, Munday added.  Last month the Care Quality Commission, which regulates the NHS, warned Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS trust that it was concerned about aspects of its performance, including that its health visitors were dealing with, on average, 500 families each.  Richard Kirby, the trust’s chief executive, told its 5,000 staff that the CQC had voiced alarm about “the pressures facing community children’s services and especially health visiting and the risks that these posed to our ability to provide safe care for children and families”. The trust has begun “an extensive programme of improvement” and case loads now average 440, a spokesman said.  Sarah Carpenter, Unite’s head of health, said: “With high case loads there are increased risks of baby deaths from poor health or abuse, of maternal mental health issues that unspoken about could lead to attempts at suicide, and undiscovered domestic violence with trauma for all involved. The inability of those staff left in the demoralised health visiting service to deliver the service that they want and need to deliver leads to horrific longer-term problems for families, and a longer-term cost for the NHS as it struggles to repair the damage caused by lack of early intervention.”  Health visitors in Brighton and Hove have the smallest case loads in England, with each one responsible for just 73 under-fives. Blackpool has the second smallest, with 87, followed by Wakefield with 101.  The number of health visitors rose from 7,849 in September 2010 to 10,236 in September 2015 because the coalition government made recruitment a priority. But that fell to 8,497 in September last year and again to 8,016 in May this year, as councils cut spending on public health after their grants for that purpose from central government were reduced.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Health visitors play a vital role in supporting parents and babies across the country. That’s why NHS England, NHS Improvement and Health Education England are working with trusts on a range of recruitment, retention and return-to-practice programmes to ensure that the required workforce are in place to deliver safe and effective services.”",9,2018-09-23 23:44:00
118,1028,"A xel Lindén is a shepherd-philosopher with James Herriot’s knack for mishap and an almost Chekhovian deadpan humour. On Sheep: Diary of a Swedish Shepherd chronicles his Sisyphean struggle to move from “newbie” sheep farmer in search of a sustainable good life to “real farmer” – “a grump who keeps to himself.”  In 2010 he ditched his day job as a literary studies lecturer in Stockholm, rejected the ills of consumerism, pulled his three children out of kindergarten and, with his somewhat reluctant lawyer-wife in tow, embarked on a sheep-rearing “project”, possibly long term, possibly not. Either way, Lindén, then 46, “wanted out” of the city and unethical consumerism and into nature.  “I wanted to be out there, feeling the cold in my fingers,” he writes, “hitting myself on the thumb and wearing my trousers out at the knees.”  So far, so Seamus Heaney gritty and elemental. But during the move to his parents’ old farm, Lindén was reading a lot of Proust, “a writer,” he concedes, “who is the opposite of being grounded in practical, hands-on reality”. Still an ideas man at this stage, Lindén didn’t see himself as part of the natural world, in the manner of the American transcendentalist nature poet William Thoreau, one of his literary pin-ups. He had no plans to be a sheep either, in the manner of British nature writer Charles Foster, who lived as a badger, even eating worms.  Lindén’s wife was “not so keen on animals”. He went off and bought 12 ewes and 16 lambs. She preferred cats. Rearing a flock on five rented hectares of the former family farm (his father was a dairy farmer) was part of a non-mechanical means to a non-profit end: small-scale sustainable living.  Eight years in, his wife is happily growing their vegetables and flowers, the freezer is stocked with lamb and Lindén has come to know “that seductive sensation of being in direct contact with the natural world”. He now lives in a state of profound empathy with his ovine charges. “You become part of them, and they of you,” he says. “It sounds silly, but it has given me an inner peace.”  The transformation was incremental. At first Lindén spent a lot of time putting up fences that promptly fell down, fixing escape holes and reflecting on the psychology of his lost sheep. The manual labour and round-the-clock responsibility for his flock absorbed him: he thought less and less about himself, improving his mental health by weaning himself off the need for praise, and coming to live in the present – that holy grail of 21st-century states of being. But then, even a sense of responsibility and of doing a job slipped away, a feeling “best captured in the notion that I’m not the one who has the sheep; it’s the sheep who have me.” His co-habitants dictate the way of things.  “You learn about sheep, how they function; it’s more than pure knowledge. It’s like a feeling in a deeper sense – what it would feel like to eat grass and have it ruminate inside you. You see the way they form their group – sometimes spread out, sometimes packed together. When you think why they do that, there isn’t a straight answer. It’s a complex world that comes to you – and so you have to change to another thought and then to another and not necessarily come to an answer.”  Trust becomes mutual, he says. Sometimes, after counting the sheep or checking up on a weaker lamb, “You lose track of time and just sit down, waiting for them to gather around you and, without really thinking about it, you become part of the flock.” They are “unpretentious and stoical,” rather like Lindén, so it’s no surprise when he adds: “Sheep are special. They really allow you to contemplate. Cows,” by contrast, “are quite hectic. With sheep, you can lie down among them.”  “I am not the person I was when I first came here,” he says, and part of the reason for that is how he bonds with the land, as well as the sheep. He became rerooted in it, writing that “my childish tender feet trod on the ancestors of these very nettles” and that during the first half of his life his development was almost “a copy of industrialism itself: rational, progressive, urban. The sheep are making me barefoot again, so to speak. A return to simple things. Only what is simple turns out to be extremely complex, with many different facets.”",3,2018-09-23 23:44:08
119,1029,"The dilemma I have been married for 17 years and we have three beautiful children, aged between 12 and 17. Over the past 10 years our marriage has become more and more unsatisfying. We don’t feel emotionally close any more. It seems we are sticking it out for the kids, so neither of us has to leave. However, our loveless, long-term cohabitation is becoming increasingly difficult to bear.  My husband is a kind and good-hearted man, but I have often felt neglected. We hardly talk about things that matter to us, schedule in quality time or have any kind of sexual relationship. I think I have emotionally prepared myself to count on myself if I want to make things happen. At present I can’t even stand to share the same bed with him as I have been feeling a lot of resentment.  I am aware that my husband has his own struggles (supporting his family abroad), which have caused him a lot of financial pressure, tiredness and lack of enthusiasm. But I also feel that I’m not living life to the fullest.  Mariella replies You’re probably right. Over time our relationships do tend to lose their romantic lustre and battling to retain some semblance of an emotional connection, rather than just existing in tolerable proximity, becomes quite the challenge. You two sound like you’ve reached a bit of an impasse and if you’re not careful, whether it’s what you desire or not, you’ll end up allowing inertia to force you apart.  It’s easy to pontificate about tolerance and investment in a relationship and far harder to put it into practice. During times of difficulty it’s imperative we remember why we got hitched in the first place. Can you remember what you felt 17 years ago and isolate the changes that have occurred that have left you feeling dissatisfied today? I replied to a letter recently from a woman who was desperate to get married but whose partner was less enthusiastic, and it got me thinking about why we hitch ourselves to another human being for life. It’s rarely a rational choice. No one is a guaranteed safe bet as a spouse and so many relationships flounder under the weight of expectation, accruing years, or from one partner giving up hope and seeking solace elsewhere.  So why does it seem so imperative to confirm your determination to last the course in front of friends and family, even signing a contract to that effect? Far from being the perfect way to announce your besottedness to the world, it seems to me more of an attempt to shore up the relationship in anticipation of future discord. You don’t need a reminder of your intentions when you can’t wait to rip each other’s clothes off, but it certainly comes in handy when you’re moving your things into the spare bedroom. I don’t mean the dividing of assets in the event of divorce, which is never less than fractious – I mean in terms of thinking long and hard before we call it quits.",9,2018-09-23 23:44:11

123,1033,"S ince 2015 the Twitter account Mumsnet Madness has been documenting notable discussions from the site’s message boards. My recent favourites include the woman who “scalded her vagina with her own gas”, the one who, having organised a party for her nine-year-old DS (darling son) at Pizza Express, heard from another mother that her DD would only come if they changed the venue, as the girl “deeply opposes large corporate chains and prefers to support locally owned eateries”. And of course I look back with fond nostalgia at the famous “penis beaker” thread.  While I do enjoy its handy edit of the nuttier scrapings of the female mind, I sometimes read with one eye closed. The phrase “guilty pleasure” is one I’m loath to use, seeing as today it usually refers to “liking Abba” or “reading Marian Keyes” or something that feels so pure and joyful the user suspects they must be doing it wrong or else requires penance for such sweet jollity. But here it feels apt. Though I love a bitchy chuckle (also available for purchase as a regional drag name), my guilt comes from the knowledge that these women, with their baked-in passive aggression and fascination with semen, were posting on the Mumsnet message boards under the assumption their secrets would be read only by people in their own online community, rather than sneering onlookers like me, horrified mainly by the abbreviations.  It was with this in mind that I paused on last week’s thoughts from Catriona Jones, a researcher at the University of Hull, who claimed that the “tsunami” of detailed accounts of labour can be so traumatising that it’s leading to a rise in tokoph obia – an extreme fear of childbirth. “If you go into Mumsnet forums, women are telling stories about childbirth – ‘It’s terrible, it’s a bloodbath’. I think that can be difficult to deal with,” she said. And, yes, fine, but what can be even more difficult to deal with is, hearing either flowery platitudes about the wonder of childbirth or, upon asking friends what it’s like, receiving only dark-eyed tuts from women who themselves have been warned off sharing details.  Then, one morning somewhere close to dawn, going on to push an entire human through the creaking architecture of your body, and afterwards, being told to shut up and swallow it. In a time when talking about one’s trauma is largely accepted to be a positive and necessary thing, when we are bombarded with messaging that urges us to open up about mental health, even, post-#MeToo, about the value for others of “speaking our truth”, this suggestion that women should keep quiet about childbirth feels woefully outdated.  The similarity between the trivia of Mumsnet Madness and Jones’s research is that both involve mining the message boards, the quiet coffee mornings of Mumsnet users, where they talk to each other in a seemingly safe space about their specialist subject – the secret lives of women. Married sex, the limits of hygiene, their fears and neuroses, the private names they have for genitals – I find something terribly icky about exploiting these conversations, about their appropriation as a sprawling database about womankind. And then, turning the chatter back on them, feels particularly alarming.  It reminds me of an afternoon in 1990, when my teacher took my diary. I was 10, and he took my diary, and then read sections out to the class. That afternoon he called my mum and told her I’d sworn (in my diary) and been disrespectful about him (in my diary). Looking back now, I can chart the way that experience scarred the rest of my life, changing its course as if a character in a Jonathan Coe novel. The things I wrote in there were particular to the place they sat – the stories that Mumsnet users share online are the same. Few would contemplate broadcasting details of their partner’s post-coital bedside dunking cup if they knew the story would be used by a columnist in a national newspaper to bolster her opinions about childbirth. Oh.  As girls, we grow up with the knowledge that childbirth will be excruciating and bloody, but also that it ends. We children were walking proof of that. To suggest that those clicking on Mumsnet would be surprised to learn that labour hurts, or that it can be traumatic, is patronising and foolish. And for the women sharing their bad experiences, this is one of few places where their stories are welcomed – not only does the NHS have little time to spend listening to outpatients, but also families have a cut-off point, when it’s considered appropriate instead to focus on the positives. While a disturbing number of women do have traumatic births, for most the experience is not simply one thing, pain or pleasure. A multitude of stories are required, not just to help those telling them to work out their own narratives, or to help those looking for information, but to challenge tokophobia by enriching and complicating our cultural understanding of childbirth. Because, like Mumsnet Madness, there’s some magic, in among the horror.  One more thing…  Don’t do as I did and listen to the podcast Dr Death when eating. Before his conviction last year, neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch maimed 32 victims in Texas. Grisly details about the intentional mistakes he made, including (oh God) a screw drilled into a spinal cavity, do not make for happy lunches. He’s now serving a life sentence.  The White House defence of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sniffs at accusations of sexual assault, suggesting that ‘every man’ at some point may have pinned a girl down, turned the music up to drown out her cries and covered her mouth as he assaulted her. Which, to me, seems a fairly bleak view of ‘every man’.  Last week I went to the 15th annual Art Car Boot Fair in King’s Cross, London. It’s always a complete joy, like returning to art school but fatter and more cynical, and with a four-year-old child who wants to dance next to the rave speakers. I love it.

125,1035,"E arly one Sunday morning a month ago, a German carpenter was fatally stabbed in a street fight in Chemnitz in eastern Germany. Little is known about how the brawl started, but rumours rapidly circulated online that the man was defending a woman from sexual assault. Within hours of his death, rumours that his killers were two refugees triggered a violent reaction. For two nights running, thousands of rightwing extremists and sympathisers took to the streets of the city . Shocking videos of demonstrators openly using the Nazi salute (a criminal offence in Germany) and chasing and attacking people of foreign appearance rapidly appeared online.  The reverberations of the riots continue to roil German politics and society. They appear to have given a massive boost to the right-wing AfD party, for example, which according to some opinion polls is now in second place in Germany. And last week, Angela Merkel removed the head of the domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maaßen , from his post after he faced criticism for his reaction to anti-immigrant protests in the city of Chemnitz. He had cast doubt on the authenticity of the videos showing dark-skinned people being chased and attacked.  What’s going on? How did many Germans become so worked up about a street brawl?

126,1036,"I s this year’s Labour conference in Liverpool going to rise to the occasion and put the party firmly on the road to stopping Brexit?  With mounting support among trade unionists for a “people’s vote”, it would be a welcome outcome if what my old friend and Observer colleague Alan Watkins called “the people’s party” finally got its act together in the interests of the country and all working people.  It was Liverpool in the early 1980s that witnessed the nadir of Labour’s near-capture by the extreme-left Militant Tendency. The shameful absurdity of it all was captured in a magnificent conference speech by Neil Kinnock, in which he had scathing words for a council under the control of one Derek Hatton that had sent redundancy notices to council workers by taxi.  Redundancy notices? Yes, the council’s funds were being so mismanaged that “economies” were deemed necessary. That notice of these economies was being sent to the victims by taxi was surreal.

127,1037,"U ntil about five years ago, Ralph Taylor did not consider himself black. He lived as a white man and was seen as such by friends, colleagues and clients. In 2010, he took a genetic test that estimated his ancestry to be 90% European, 6% indigenous American and 4% sub-Saharan African. Four years later, he applied for his insurance business to be certified as a “disadvantaged business enterprise” to make it easier to win government contracts. He was turned down. Officials could find “no persuasive evidence that Mr Taylor has personally suffered social and economic disadvantage by virtue of being a Black American”. Now Taylor is suing the US government because he considers himself to be “black based upon DNA evidence”.  Taylor is, by any rational definition, white and the attempt to have himself officially declared black seems little more than a money-spinning exercise. Yet, absurd though his claims are, his case speaks also to our times. Navigating racial categories has today become increasingly fraught and many of the ways in which we commonly think of racial and cultural identities are as hollow as Taylor’s claim to be black.  “I wanted to know who I am,” claims “Kim” in a television advert for the testing company Ancestry.com. “The most shocking result,” she tells us, “is that I’m 26% Native American”. “This is what I’m made of,” she explains. “I absolutely want to know more about my Native American heritage.”  Genetic testing has become a billion-dollar industry – more than 12 million people have taken such tests to discover “ who I am ”. The dubious character of the results has been well rehearsed. It means no more to say that Kim is Native American than to say Taylor is black. Yet the idea that DNA tells us something fundamental about our social identity and sense of belonging has become embedded. The American geneticist Rick Kittles, founder of the genetic testing company African Ancestry, traced his maternal line to the Hausa tribe in Nigeria. Learning about Hausa culture and traditions, Kittles wrote, “gave me sense about who I am”.  His comments reflect the way that notions of race, culture and identity are increasingly becoming conflated. From local authority adoption policies to the debate over “ Cheddar Man ”, there is a desire to link genetic inheritance to social heritage to contemporary identity.  In the past, it was racists who obsessed about racial categories, devising systems by which to divide populations. Anti-racists challenged both the process of racial categorisation and the use of such categories to enforce discrimination.  Today, the struggle against racism is defined as much by a desire for identity and recognition as by a demand for equality. The very meaning of equality has changed. Where once it meant the right to be treated equally despite differences of race or ethnicity or culture, now equality means the right to be treated differently because of them.  “Stay in your lane” has become a favoured demand of anti-racists; meaning “do not interfere with what rightfully is in the domain of other racial or cultural groups”. One fashionable expression of this is the furore over cultural appropriation – the insistence that people should not, without “permission”, borrow from a culture that is not theirs. Sometimes, the issue is trivial, as in the condemnation of Jamie Oliver’s “jerk chicken” . At other times, it can be of profound importance, as in the campaign against Dana Schutz’s Open Casket , a painting of Emmett Till , an African American teenager murdered by a Mississippi lynch mob in 1955. Many objected to a white painter depicting such a traumatic moment in black history. Implicit in the campaign, the critic Adam Shatz observed, was a “disavowal that acts of radical sympathy, and imaginative identification, are possible across racial lines”.  “Know your place” used to be the cry of those who demanded that social hierarchies be maintained. Now it’s the slogan of those for whom the struggle against racism is more about policing boundaries than pursuing equality.  Some may suggest that to exclude worthless claims such as Ralph Taylor’s requires identities to be defined in more rigid ways. That is to misunderstand the problem. Whether Taylor has 4% or 40% African heritage is immaterial. What matters is the way that society treats individuals deemed to be of one race or another. What makes blackness into an issue in America is job discrimination, voter disqualification, police brutality, mass incarceration.  Racial differences are important because racism is a reality. But challenging racism requires us to confront, not embrace, claims about racial categories that are the province of racists.  • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",4,2018-09-23 23:44:44
128,1038,"S omething has been niggling me about Tesco’s new discount supermarket chain, Jack’s . Obviously, Tesco is entitled to take on the likes of Aldi and Lidl and, in this era of food banks, it’s difficult to argue against cheap produce. If the reports from the first Jack’s store, in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire (“80% British”; “Cheap alcohol”; “ Like shopping 30 years ago ”) make the general ambience sound a bit like a low-cost grocery emporium that you might find in a third-wave-austerity theme park, then that’s just a sign of the times.  What I’m concerned about is what Jack’s ( named after Tesco’s founder, Jacob “Jack” Cohen ) might be saying about an evolution in retail segregation. While different supermarket chains are obviously aimed at different people, on varying incomes, there’s something about Jack’s that whiffs a little too strongly of poorer customers being rather unsubtly “zoned”, and in a way that steers them well clear of the core Tesco brand. Basically, I’m concerned about why Jack’s is called Jack’s.  Obviously, this type of zoning goes on throughout retail. At the opposite extreme to Jack’s, Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop opens a pop-up store in London (from this week until January). With its famously high-end ludicrous musings , products and prices (vaginal steam-cleaning, Brain Dust supplements, a mere £11,500 for a gold-plated sex toy), Goop’s $250m-niche boutique concept (basically Space NK for rich, gullible simpletons) is clearly not catering for the austerity pound. Brands such as Goop are probably wary of being contaminated by the mega-discount market. However, so seemingly is Tesco.",9,2018-09-23 23:44:50

130,1040,"T he Labour party is proposing to ban parents from discovering the sex of an unborn child early in pregnancy for fear that it could lead to selective abortion.  Non-invasive screenings are now being offered at nine to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, to allow parents to discover whether a foetus has Down’s syndrome or other genetic conditions. Naz Shah , shadow women and equalities minister, told the Victoria Derbyshire show that the test could be used, particularly within Asian communities, to selectively abort girls.  A 2014 Department of Health report found no evidence of sex selection taking place in England and Wales. A later report observed: “Analysis of gender birth ratios by ethnicity of the child… found no ratio to be significantly higher than [that expected naturally].”  The issue, however, is not simply one of numbers. It is that of the state controlling what a woman is permitted to know about her pregnancy. In any other circumstance, feminists would condemn the idea that women cannot to be trusted to make decisions about their reproductive futures. It’s an attitude both patronising and misogynistic.  The NHS offers pregnant women ultrasound scans that can reveal the sex of a foetus. Abortion is legal until 24 weeks. Is Shah suggesting that parents should not be able to see their scans? The logic can be extended beyond the issue of selective abortion. Perhaps the government should stop providing information about immigration numbers for fear it might inflame anti-immigrant sentiment? Or stop telling pupils their GCSE results in case it depresses some?  Sex-selective abortions are an issue in some parts of the world, particularly India and China. The answer is to tackle attitudes, not to deny women knowledge about their own bodies.",3,2018-09-23 23:44:56
131,1041,"A wretched characteristic of UK light entertainment has been its obsession with sending our own grands hommes and dames of the television establishment overseas to make programmes. This serves two purposes: it provides some respite from veteran cravat-wearers whingeing about ageism on television and helps executives use up all the expensive spare time on those eye-watering contracts. This gives us the opportunity to see vaguely familiar thespian types mincing about in foreign kitchens or being condescending about the curious customs of the locals.  A joyous byproduct of this is watching the amusement in the faces of a benevolent foreign host as Jasper or Jemima tries to remain insouciant when confronted with les ballons de cochon in a wee sauce soubise. Other shows are frayed versions of the ones Alan Whicker used to do. Occasionally, you get a show such as the one Michael Palin is doing on Channel 5 about life inside North Korea . Half a battalion of Pyongyang’s finest are looking over his shoulder and his passport resides in the desk of a local state excellency. So we can be sure we’ll discover about as much about life beyond the 38th parallel as an open-top bus tour around Possilpark.",9,2018-09-23 23:44:58

133,1043,"W e are all familiar with the gut-wrenching, disturbing images of the German Student Union burning books under the Nazi regime. It’s less well known, perhaps, that the photograph we often associate with this time shows the burning of the libraries of Dr Magnus Hirschfeld, the first man – that we know of – to use the term transsexual and perform gender confirmation surgery on Lili Elbe (as seen in the film The Danish Girl ).  Rarely would we see book burnings today, but routinely books are challenged or banned on grounds of impropriety. Let’s start with a personal example. My guide to gender, sexual identity and LGBTQ sex education, This Book Is Gay (2014), was challenged in Wasilla, Alaska, when a parent discovered the title in the children’s non-fiction section of her local library. I concur that it is not a children’s book; it’s for young adults. I agree it should be shelved appropriately in libraries. However, before long, locals demanded that the book be removed entirely. I’m pleased to say the title remains in the YA section of Wasilla public library.  Today books are most commonly challenged where religion and state are closely tied, but the UK has form when it comes to banning books. DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1928) famously had to go through the courts to be published in its entirety in 1960. “Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?” the prosecution asked. The book was printed uncensored for the first time in the UKand led to a literary sexual awakening not seen again until Fifty Shades of Grey mania half a century later.",9,2018-09-23 23:45:07
134,1044,"L ike summer heat, it was here and now it’s gone. The colourful, inexplicable Christo installation floating on London’s Serpentine will begin to be dismantled today; all done, suddenly, with its strange business of delighting and baffling visitors to Hyde Park.  Last week, the 7,506 oil barrels of Mastaba , the artist’s 20-metre high pink, blue and red fortress, were still glinting in the evening sun when I took a trip on the Solar Boat that crosses the lake during the summer months. As we took photographs, on one side of me I could overhear praise for the artwork’s playful grandeur. On the other side, someone was grumbling about how dull and pointless it seemed.  Mastaba ’s creator, the veteran installation artist who for years worked alongside his late wife, Jeanne-Claude, has always prompted these contradictory responses. Christo has wrapped up Berlin’s Reichstag , the Pont Neuf in Paris and even a network of Australian coastal cliffs in white cloth, making some people gape and others roll their eyes. And he has a long history with oil barrels, creating his first work from them with Jeanne-Claude in 1961.",9,2018-09-23 23:45:10
135,1045,"Serial: Season 3 | serialpodcast.org Intrigue: The Ratline (Radio 4) | iPlayer  Serial 3 is here and it’s a very different proposition to Serials 1 and 2 . Serial 1 , about the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee and the subsequent conviction of Adnan Syed, was small, detailed and obsessive. It focused on one incident, fixated on tiny details. Serial 2 , which examined the case of Bowe Bergdahl, a US soldier captured by the Taliban in 2009, was also about one man, though the landscape, which moved from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Guantánamo Bay to the White House, was vast and consequential. Serial  3 changes the scale again. It’s centred on one place, but it will tell multiple tales. For Serial fans, it’s like moving from a pop song to a symphony; from West Cork to The Wire .  We are at the Justice Center in Cleveland, Ohio. This is the high-rise building that contains the city’s justice department, from jail (in the basement) to courthouses (the higher the floor, the more serious the crime). Sarah Koenig, our producer/presenter, talks us through: “The elevator really runs the place,” she says and explains why. Koenig’s opening six-and-a-half-minute description of the building is quite astonishing, like a chapter from Dickens or Maupassant. I had to keep stopping to go back, to play small parts over again, just for my own enjoyment. Such beautiful language! It makes you remember that Serial is not only about the individuals it chooses to focus on – it’s about the production: the reporting, the writing, the asides. The consistent empathy, the moral niggles, the revealing vignettes. How the story is told. Serial  3 makes you understand that what you really enjoy about Serial is Koenig and her team.  This series – “one courthouse told week by week” – promises to take us through various individual cases, and through these to an understanding of the US justice system. (This is only possible due to the access allowed to Koenig and the Serial team; they spent a year in Cleveland and seem to have recorded almost everywhere.)  And the first case seems quite straightforward, almost comically unfair, an easy decision. They chose to start with it, says Koenig, because it was “an example of the system actually working”. Except you’re left with the uneasy feeling that it didn’t… We’re told that 96% of convictions are decided on a plea bargain. So if you don’t seem completely innocent, you’ll probably end up guilty, even if only a little bit.  Innocent or guilty. All of the Serial series make listeners consider whether anyone can be completely one or the other. And, more troublingly, all Serial series also make us consider the systems around innocence and guilt. How fallible these systems are, how often they seem to get it wrong, even when we’re told they get it right.",9,2018-09-23 23:45:13
136,1046,"The Circle (Channel 4) | All4 Defending the Guilty (BBC Two) | iPlayer Mystery Road (BBC Four) | iPlayer Strangers (ITV) | ITV Hub Vanity Fair (ITV) | ITV Hub  To at least try to be fair to Channel 4, I’m possibly not falling into the precise demographic from whom it intends to coax, over the next three weeks, a slavish addiction to their big new evil experiment, The Circle . In which eight shut-off strangers – same block of flats, yet they never meet – are set against one another to compete for a £50,000 prize, by simply pretending to be, on a kind of closed-circuit social media, somebody else.  Even a few years ago I would have written that phrase, added a full stop then asked, simply: why?  Now we know better. Don’t we, though? In a time when Twitter spats can lead news bulletins and a social media presence is (we are told) both crucial and (we are also told, often in the same breath) leading to a groundswell of burgeoning harm, along come the zeitgeisty team behind Gogglebox to allow us all in on what is a common enough slice of British life but undergone a kind of dystopian reductio ad absurdum . In their three weeks’ incarceration, the contestants will shout out commands to the computer that controls their “profile” in attempts to boast, prettify, wheedle, flirt, lie, charm or connive their “personalities” to victory. Communications, for all the whizzy tech, are at heart more basic: how you doing, and so excited, and in addition to OMG-speak and WTF-speak, all have to speak fluent emoji: they will shout “Circle, make betrayed aardvark face” (or some such), and there is much, much of this. But this is not the problem.  One of the problems is that the contestants are, by and large, much less likable than, say, the folk on Gogglebox . We have, for instance, Jennifer, a 40-year-old Google Analytics something who says she hates social media – high early hopes – but for some reason pretends to be a 34-year-old oncologist. The week before a rather global thrust for Macmillan cancer care, this was always going to be a fearsome ouch. Alex (sharpest in the block) pretends to be a woman, his own girlfriend, in fact: his profile pic is of her, and he cynically manipulates his almost housemates and wins the first round. Mummy’s boy Mitchell, 22, said with something approaching pride: “Whenever people first meet me they think I’m a dickhead”, and his chosen picture is handsome enough but, fair’s fair, his personality profile is, with shocking honesty, that of someone who might be assumed to have the head of a penis. Essex Freddie, 20, utterly lies about having a dead dog (sad emojis), lies hugely about not being gay, yet is, of course, the type of impossibly tantrummed character who always seems to be inserted into things like this purely in order, it can only be assumed, to set the well-argued and clean-won case for acceptance of male homosexuality back about 65 years.  The first petal-strewn “date”, separated by only a wall but communicating with each other via the “internet” (fast-typing Channel 4 interns, I assume), is therefore between a man pretending to be his own girlfriend and a dickhead. While, somewhere below, a gay man lying about wanting a family, and a woman who’s lying about having to feed her baby , sulk. I’m of an age where I can still remember that New Yorker cartoon (now 25 years old) of a mutt hammering away at a keyboard with the caption: “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” Which has always struck me as what should have been the last word in online interactions: dress it up how you will, IRL (in real life), when eventually you meet, there’s always going to be another person pointing, no matter how politely, at your tail. At best, if you’re very lucky and not actually in jail, patting their pockets vaguely for treats.  As has been pointed out (on, um, social media), this particular dystopia bears a remarkable similarity to Black Mirror ’s Nosedive episode. In some ways it’s a slice of genius, a fast lesson in the communications, the mores, the aspirations, of people younger than me, even if some of those are depressingly familiar (the svelte lass with the bright, sexy eyes triumphs: boring is not so bad if he’s rich). And, socially, I’m intrigued. It’s just… do I have the patience, over three weeks, to watch eight people trying to invent eight other people when none of the 16 are, in fact, that interesting in the first place?",9,2018-09-23 23:45:20
137,1047,"I f a picture is worth a thousand words, a great portrait must equal some 700 pages of print. Hans Holbein the Younger’s depiction of Thomas Cromwell – dark, brooding, sinister and suggestive – is the likeness that has shaped the tormented afterlife of Henry VIII’s master secretary. That’s the image challenged by Hilary Mantel ’s bestselling novels, and it also haunts every line of Diarmaid MacCulloch’s compendious work. Between Holbein on the one hand and Mantel on the other, there is plenty of room for an alternative version. This is the life that professor MacCulloch has set himself to write.  Except that it’s not really a life, more a life and times, the fruit of many years in the archives, a history as much as a biography that weighs in with almost 30 pages of bibliography and 115 dense pages of notes. MacCulloch once sat at the feet of that fearsome medieval historian Geoffrey Elton and cannot quite forget his mentor’s bristling moustache.  In the quest for “the true Thomas Cromwell of history”, this heavyweight volume is intended to be a knockout blow. Mantel’s fulsome pre-publication puff (“the biography we have been awaiting for 400 years”) certainly advertises one satisfied customer. A more dispassionate reading might find the historian-biographer, who must live and die by the written record, swamped by the teeming documents of Henry’s reign. This was a pivotal moment between medieval and modern England to which the IT revolution of the Renaissance contributed a cornucopia of ink and paper. One of the many incidental fascinations of this book is its picture of Cromwell the bibliophile, and the role of print in stoking the furnace of Henry’s extraordinary reign.",9,2018-09-23 23:45:23
138,1048,"The first thing the Nazis took from Freddie Oversteegen was her bed.  Her mother, Trijn, a communist bringing up her children independently in the Dutch city of Haarlem, sheltered Jews, dissidents and gay people as they fled Germany in the 1930s. Oversteegen, who was seven when Adolf Hitler came to power, bunked in with her big sister Truus to make room.  It was the start of a struggle that would last until she died on 5 September, the day before her 93rd birthday, in a nursing home not far from where, as teenagers, she and Truus carried out a campaign of assassinations and sabotage against Nazi invaders with pistols hidden in their bicycle baskets.  “If you ask me, the war only ended two weeks ago,” her son Remi Dekker told the Observer . “In her mind it was still going on, and on, and on. It didn’t stop, even until the last day.”  Oversteegen’s war began one Friday in May 1940 with planes roaring overhead and the smell of smoke. Realising the Nazis had invaded the Netherlands , her family began burning their radical literature.

140,1050,"I made myself a slice of thick toast, its crumb chewy, its crust as black as soot, then spread the surface with a snowy mound of ricotta and pieces of jelly-fleshed apricot. This treat never quite made it to the table and I ate it while standing at the kitchen counter. Then, a few minutes later, a second piece of bread, this time untoasted with a swirl of the ricotta, its crest pushed down into a hollow deep enough to hold a pool of olive oil. Unmediated, almost spontaneous. Eaten out of pure greed after coming home with a fresh loaf and white cheese as soft as cream.  Ricotta barely makes it as a cheese. Traditionally made from the whey left behind after the curds that will become cheese are removed and start their journey to the maturing room, this is the lightest, gentlest-tasting dairy product, next to milk. It has no body to speak of, and can be spread like whipped cream. I like it with strawberries. You can make ricotta al caffe, the famous desert with ricotta and espresso, or use it in a cheesecake to lighten the mixture of eggs, mascarpone or cream cheese.  I like it folded into whipped cream as a filling for a sponge cake to be eaten for lunch with raspberries, though it is probably best known as a stuffing, with tiny nibs of candied peel and shards of dark chocolate, in a crisp, cigar-shaped cannoli. If you dust the finished pastry with icing sugar rather than trying to sweeten the ricotta itself, the filling is less likely to weep.  For lunch the other day, I brought a dish of baked ricotta to the table, the cheese set into a firm soufflé with eggs and thyme. We piled it on to our plates with roasted tomatoes and spooned over the basil-scented juices. Slicing it like a cake I ate the leftovers the next day, with a dollop of tomato chutney.  Salted ricotta, where the fresh curds are drained, salted and pressed, has been the most useful addition to my fridge this summer. The piquant logs of cheese have been crumbled into bowls of raw, roughly chopped peas, or cooked and skinned broad beans, or broken into tiny, gravel-sized nuggets and tossed with basil leaves and olive oil as a dressing for green-shouldered tomatoes. Add a squeeze of lemon and you have a vibrant dressing for the heart of a lettuce or raw shredded cabbage, or you could fold it through chunks of chilled watermelon.  It is fair to say it works better as a seasoning than as a principal ingredient and yet many times this summer I found myself breaking off a chalky lump and wolfing it as I might a piece of feta. Another of my little standing-at-the-kitchen-counter pleasures.  Baked ricotta with thyme  This is one of those recipes that works both hot and cold, though isn’t at its best served straight from the fridge. Feel free to add a pinch of dried chilli flakes or a little dried mint. I haven’t added salt to the mix but you may wish to, depending on the age of your parmesan. The older, firmer cheeses may well be salty enough.  Serves 4  ricotta 500g eggs 2 thyme leaves 1 tbsp parmesan 95g, grated  Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Transfer the ricotta to a mixing bowl and lightly mash it with a wooden spoon.  Break the eggs into a bowl, beat well with a fork, then fold into the ricotta with finely ground black pepper. Roughly chop the thyme leaves then mix with all but 2 tbsp of the parmesan.  Fold the thyme and parmesan into the ricotta then spoon into an oven dish. Smooth the surface then scatter the reserved grated cheese over the top.  Place the dish in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes until the ricotta has risen and the crust is golden brown.

143,1053,"Domaine du Cros Lo Sang del Pais, France, 2016 (£8.95, The Wine Society ; Buon Vino ) The southwest of France boasts a cluster of wine regions that have never quite got the attention they deserve. This is almost entirely down to what the French cutely call le marketing . The regions are too diverse and individualistic, as well as being too geographically spread out, for any Mad Men or women to think up a single convincing story to tell about them as a group (à la Bordeaux). But each is too small to make enough noise on its own in a crowded international wine market. It means the wines don’t tend to stray too far from home, and even in the rest of France, appellations such as the tiny Marcillac in the Aveyron, where the fer servadou grape is used to make this super-succulent, red-berried, iron-streaked light red, are scarcely known.  Domaine d’Escausses Cuvée des Drilles, France, 2016 (£9.99, Les Caves ) Along the river Tarn about 30 miles north of Toulouse, Gaillac is one of France’s original fine-wine areas: the Romans noted its greatness. Today, it’s one of its most diverse: there is a cacophony of different styles, grape varieties, and producer variations, which makes it hard to pin down. Many first encounter it through the spritzy Gaillac Perlé – a fun, fresh, appley dry white with a prickle of light bubbles, of which Tesco finest Gaillac Perlé 2017 (£7) is a typically lip-smacking example. It also has a nice line in fuller whites and sweet wines, the latter for matching with local foie gras, while the reds are no less multifarious, with my own preference being for peppery, thirst-quenchingly tangy styles, such as the Cuvée des Drilles, It’s made from a mix of local duras with fer servadou.  Mas del Périé Les Escures, France, 2017 (£17, The Sampler ; Caviste ) The two best-known appellations in southwest France make powerful red wines from grape varieties that have, curiously, become stars in South America: Cahors, the original home of malbec, and Madiran, where the muscular tannat reaches its fullest, craggiest expression. Like Gaillac, Cahors has only recently begun to regain a historical reputation for fine red wine, one that reached its heights in medieval times. The vineyards along the Lot river are capable of producing truly beautiful malbec with, in the case of Les Escures, a mix of perfume and red and black-fruited depth. Gascon Madiran, meanwhile, is all about contoured power with, as in Domaine Berthoumieu Cuvée Charles de Batz 2013 (£15.75, Cheers Wine Merchants; Noel Young Wines), inky black fruit, burly tannin, and minerals.

147,1057,"W ith attention turning to the price of mobile phones, as the latest versions of the iPhone hit the UK market, a very large number of consumers are wondering how much they have paid for the phone in their hand.  New research says that about 4 million people have been paying for handsets they already own as EE, Three and Vodafone “routinely” carry on charging customers.  The mobile phone market is one where consumers have frequently been found to be paying too much – whether by buying excessive data for what they need, or shelling out far more than they need to for their device.  Here are the solutions to make sure you are not paying too much:  Owning it and still paying  When consumers sign up for a “bundled” contract, including the mobile phone and the service, they are typically locked in for a minimum term, such as 24 months, and cannot leave without paying an early termination charge.  At the end of the term, they are free to leave and use the different options available. However, research from Citizens Advice suggests that millions are still being charged for phones that they have paid for after the contract ends, even though they own the phone.  The charity has highlighted EE , Three and Vodafone in this, and says the pricing of mobile services and phones should be separated out.  More than one in three people go beyond their minimum contract, usually for six months, and many are unaware they are still being charged even though they own the phone, according to the research. This is a simmering problem that has been highlighted before by media regulator Ofcom, which found that one in every seven mobile phone owners don’t know the status of their contract.  The problem is not industry-wide, however – Billmonitor, a website that analyses customer bills and offers the best deal according to usage, says Tesco and O2 Refresh will automatically stop charging for handset costs and make adjustments to payments.  Ofcom found that one in every four consumers don’t know that they can simply get a standalone sim card and greatly reduce their monthly bills. The regulator has proposed that operators be required to send a notification to their customers 40 to 70 days before the end of the term.  EE last week said the splitting idea from Citizens Advice was overly simplistic and that the best way to avoid customers being overcharged was to have clear communications about their options. Three says it makes the lengths of contracts clear to new customers, and Vodafone says it contacts customers when they are approaching the end of their contracts to let them know their options.  How to avoid the problem? The answer is simple. Set a reminder on your email or phone for the end of the contract and then stop paying the full “bundled” amount. Go to the market and look for a sim-only deal that best suits your needs.  Fear of bill shock  Reaching the limit on your data before the next bill can be frustrating but also expensive, as add-on packages are typically pricey. This leads many to overestimate usage when they sign up for a deal, in turn paying for data they do not need.  Klaus Henke of Billmonitor says many people are sold a package but do not investigate whether it is the right one.  “If you walk the high street, you will probably find two or three offers saying you can get 20GB for £25 or ‘We double your data’. If you have 3GB they give you an extra 3GB. And you might ask yourself, ‘Why give me that for free?’  “The answer is so you can get used to the idea of having 6GB. The next time you are due for renewal, you buy a 6GB bundle, which will cost you more. But actually you are not using the 3GB,” he says.  Previous research from Citizens Advice found that staff selling mobile phones were recommending tariffs that were 130% more expensive than necessary for the customer.  Keeping a close eye on usage will make selecting a deal easier. Billmonitor and ctrlio compare tariffs according to use.  Watch the bundle price  The most common form of mobile contract is the bundled deal. Also common within these deals is the lack of information about the effective cost of the phone, according to Citizens Advice.  While most people think that they are the cheaper option, in almost three out of four cases, consumers are paying more than they would if they were buying a phone outright.  Behind this is the frequently high prices networks apply to bundled deals, where consumers are effectively taking a loan from the network in order to pay off the device.  These rates – really interest rates – can be over 50% on the latest deals for the new range of iPhones, according to Unshackled.com, a business founded on the premise of allowing customers to buy their phones and sim cards separately.  Some networks operate agreements where things such as annual percentage rates (APR) do not need to be disclosed, says commercial director Dan Melia.  The obvious solution is to buy the phone outright, thus avoiding the necessity for lengthy and costly contracts. The downside, however, is that many people do not have the hefty price readily available – the new iPhone Xs is £999 – so have to revert to financing. Apple operates iPhone Payments, which spreads the cost of the phone over 20 months at 0% APR with a £69 upfront payment and a credit check.  Another way to get interest-free credit is to use a 0% credit card and then set up a direct debit to pay it off each month. The minimum monthly payments have to be made to ensure interest charges do not kick in.  Some reseller sites can undercut buying the phone direct with a separate sim, according to research from Martin Lewis’s Moneysavingexpert.  In one case, buying a phone and 4GB of data allowance from Vodafone – via Mobiles.co.uk – comes in at £1,092 over 24 months, cheaper than the £1,191 bill from buying outright from Apple and then paying £8 a month for a sim with 3.5GB of data.",9,2018-09-23 23:46:04

In an interview with Andrew Marr, Corbyn said of May’s final Brexit deal: “We would vote it down if it didn’t meet out tests, in order to send the government – if it is still in office – straight back to the negotiating table.”",3,2018-09-23 23:46:06
149,1074,"The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab , has dismissed claims Theresa May could call a snap general election in the autumn to save her Brexit plans as he played down the chances of the government pivoting towards a Canada-style free trade deal.  The cabinet minister said it was “for the birds” to suggest the prime minister could go to the country after Brussels rejected her Chequers proposals at a summit in Salzburg last week . “It’s not going to happen,” he said on Sunday.  Raab insisted the government would keep negotiating with the EU on the basis of Chequers. “This is a bump in the road. We will hold our nerve, we will keep our cool and we will keep negotiating in good faith. I think we need to keep these negotiations going,” he said.  EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to Chequers, which is likely to appear in early October – after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make-or-break summit in Brussels.  However, Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we are not going to do is be dictated to. The UK is one of the biggest economies in Europe , if not in the world. We have come up with a serious set of proposals … We are not just going to flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly. We are going to be resolute about this.”  The Brexit secretary also played down suggestions, raised by Jeremy Hunt on Saturday , that the government was pivoting away from its existing plans towards a free trade deal, as demanded by the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party.",3,2018-09-23 23:46:09
150,1075,"A 15-year-old girl who was severely allergic to sesame died after eating a Pret a Manger sandwich that did not list the ingredient on its packaging, an inquest will hear this week.  Natasha Ednan-Laperouse was travelling with her father and a school friend from London to Nice when she collapsed during the British Airways flight in July 2016.  The inquest, which is expected to last five days, is likely to examine product-labelling laws and raise questions about whether gaps in regulation need to be tightened.  It will hear that, shortly before boarding the plane, the teenager had eaten an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from the main Pret a Manger shop in Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport.  She collapsed on the plane and, despite her father administering two doses of drugs to revive her using EpiPens, was declared dead later that day at the university hospital of Nice.  The coroner will hear evidence from the girl’s father Nadim, the millionaire founder of the Wow Toys company, as well as the Pret store manager on the day the girl bought the baguette, and the head of safety and compliance at the UK-based food chain, which has 500 stores worldwide and was sold in May to a German investment fund for £1.5bn . The British Airways captain and the flight crew will also give evidence.  “As a family now of three, my wife, son and I are still trying to adjust to life without our beloved girl,” said Ednan-Laperouse, who is being represented by Leigh Day solicitors.  “It’s a daily battle and the pain is indescribable.

152,1077,"A leak of Russian government data about the suspects in the Salisbury poisoning may provide a rare insight into how Russia’s military intelligence agency provides cover identities for its agents abroad.  Investigative journalists have unearthed what appears to be a series of passports with similar numbers belonging to suspected Russian intelligence officers, including the Salisbury suspects Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov.  The passport holders include a former Russian military attache who was expelled from Poland for espionage in 2014 and is alleged to be tied to an attempted coup in Montenegro.  Other men with similar passport numbers identified by the St Petersburg-based Fontanka news site listed their address as Khoroshevskoye Shosse 76 B, the Moscow headquarters of Russia’s Main Directorate, the military agency often referred to as the GRU.  Their travel records, as reported by Fontanka, could be tied to recent diplomatic incidents in Europe and, in at least one case, matched the details of a foreign trip taken by Vladimir Putin.  If the reporting is confirmed, it would be a major blunder by the intelligence agency, allowing any country to check passport data for Russians requesting visas or entering the country against a list of nearly 40 passport files of suspected GRU officers.  Putin has said publicly that Petrov and Boshirov are civilians and have no connection to the Russian government. But passport information first published by Bellingcat and the Russian investigative site the Insider showed that Petrov’s file was marked “top secret” and instructed officials to “give no information” and telephone a number belonging to the Russian military base on Khoroshevskoye Shosse in Moscow.  The passport information was retrieved from a Russian government database, the sites said. It was not clear how they gained access to that database, although some Russian passport data has been leaked online before.  Other elements of Petrov and Boshirov’s passport information also indicated they are not ordinary citizens. Both men had received their passports from an elite passport authority, 777001, which Bellingcat said was “exclusively used for state VIPs and intelligence officers”.  The two men had virtually identical passport numbers, separated by only three digits. Others in that series included Col Eduard Shishmakov, a Russian military officer who had been expelled from Poland for spying and was alleged to have wired money to Serbia via Western Union in preparation for an abortive coup in neighbouring Montenegro.  Fontanka managed to speak with one man named on the list of close to 40 passports, who said he was retired and denied being in military intelligence despite listing GRU headquarters as his address.  Other men on the list, such as Petrov and Boshirov, appeared “to have come from nowhere”, having no social media accounts or property history in Russia , but had nonetheless managed to travel, Fontanka said.",3,2018-09-23 23:46:23

The group said he had been captured in the city of Deir ez-Zor a month ago.

160,1085,"I n 2011, 27-year-old Harvard graduate Sonia Vallabh got the worst news possible: she was carrying a genetic mutation that would almost certainly lead to a rare and fatal brain disease called fatal familial insomnia. The same genetic error – a single wrong letter of DNA in her “prion” gene – had caused the death of her mother the year before. But rather than despairing, she and her husband, Eric Minikel , ditched their successful careers in law and engineering and set out on a quest to find a cure. Seven years on, they have developed a treatment that they hope will slow or even prevent the onset of the devastating illness.  Sonia Vallabh  When did you first become aware your family was affected by prion disease? It was a complete surprise. We didn’t have a known family history of this disease. It all happened really abruptly in 2010 when my mum became ill. She was 51 years old and healthy. Over the course of weeks there was a really sudden onset. It was like watching a time-lapse video. We’ve since learned that’s just the way this disease is.  In January she was healthy. By March she was really severely confused, unable to navigate the world alone and unable to get to the end of a sentence. And that continued at a rate that was really shocking.  Was getting a diagnosis a struggle? If you don’t have a diagnosis, which we didn’t, we didn’t know whether this was something she could recover from or whether it was something she would be like for the next 30 years.  Should I be quitting my job and moving home? No idea.  In December we got a preliminary diagnosis of prion disease. That allowed the family to make a decision to take her off life support. But it was only after she passed away that we discovered that it had been genetic prion disease. That had not been part of the conversation before that and came as such a shock and a blow to us.  How easy was the decision to get tested? For both of Eric and me, it was immediately obvious that I needed to get tested. We were sure we couldn’t go back to a place before we knew I was at risk. Maybe the coin would flip the right way, but if it was going to be hanging over our head for ever, we might as well find out.  A lot of people would agonise over that decision, but it seems as though your mind was made up to find out? The worst time was the time when we were waiting and the worst day was when I found out I was at risk at all. We were waiting for two months after I sent in my sample. I woke up every day thinking about it. I was constantly flipping the coin, flipping the coin.  How did you feel, getting the positive diagnosis? After we got the result, it was a crushing moment. But the recovery that came after that surprised me. We really did start to assimilate within a week or two to the new normal. In some ways, it was a relief to just know and to think, OK, now we figure out the next thing.  We heard this refrain of “There’s nothing you can do” [because there was no existing cure]. I have come to feel really strongly that that’s not the case. It has been really empowering to have this information. Last year, we had a daughter through PGD (pre-implantation genetic diagnosis). That was empowered through knowing my status. It’s not a bullet-proof procedure and it’s certainly very intensive to go through. We were so lucky and had a mutation-negative daughter.  You made a radical career change – how did that come about? It all happened really fast. I was a recent law school graduate and I felt I needed to take a sabbatical to become as informed as I could about the disease. I took time away from my job and read papers and enrolled in a night class in molecular biology. Someone I came across said he knew of a lab that was hiring a technician full-time. That became my first job in science. Eric followed me a few months later. He’d been working as a transportation planner, but had a strong computer science background and pointed it over to bioinformatics.",3,2018-09-23 23:47:01
161,1086,"I n the past five years, more than 5 million museum visitors have queued – and queued some more – for a brief glimpse of the work of Yayoi Kusama. The 89-year-old Japanese artist, who for the past 41 years has lived voluntarily in a psychiatric hospital, has had large-scale solo shows of her work in Mexico City, Rio, Seoul, Taiwan and Chile, as well as major touring exhibitions in the US and Europe. Last year, she opened her own five-storey gallery in Tokyo . The Broad museum in Los Angeles recently sold 90,000 $25 tickets in an afternoon to its Kusama exhibition, causing the LA Times to ask if the artist was now “Hotter than Hamilton ?”  As the numbers have gone up, so the time that each visitor can spend in Kusama’s installations – her immersive “infinity mirror rooms” of coloured lights, and painted pumpkins and polka dots that reflect for ever – has gone down. In 2013 the David Zwirner gallery in New York was restricting time slots to 45 seconds for each viewer. Five years on, visitors to the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC, who queued for more than two hours, were down to a brisk half a minute.  How did this happen? The most obvious single word answer is “Instagram”. People – hundreds of thousands of them (see #YayoiKusama or #InfiniteKusama ) – photograph themselves in Kusama’s unique spacey wonderlands and share the results. Many modern art galleries are currently exploring the idea of exhibition as uploadable social media “experience”. Kusama – in developing an idea she first presented in New York in 1966 – has already cornered the market.  This autumn sees more new work on display at the Victoria Miro gallery in London – only two years since its last open-all-hours event. The exhibition coincides with the UK release of a film about the artist’s extraordinary life, Kusama: Infinity . The story of the making of the film is indicative of the ways Kusama’s fortunes have soared. Its director, Heather Lenz, first tried to get the idea off the ground in 2001. She pitched the story to every production company she could think of and was told the same thing by all of them. Her idea was “too arty”, Kusama had “no name recognition”, and “no one wants to watch a movie about a woman artist”. No longer.",9,2018-09-23 23:47:04
162,1087,"Sophie Walker founded the Women’s Equality party three years ago out of frustration with mainstream politicians’ progress towards gender equality. At the last general election she stood (and lost) in Shipley against the Conservative MP and men’s rights campaigner Philip Davies , renowned for his attacks on political correctness. She is a former journalist.  Young women and girls’ happiness has declined sharply in a decade, according to a survey out this week – what’s that telling us? I think we’re a very long way from understanding that all of our systems are still built around a template of men, and women and girls face a deeply uncomfortable existence around the margins of that template. And until we start to redraw it in a way that understands that the old models don’t work, we’re never going to be able to solve that general unhappiness that is as a result of being second-class citizens.  Do you really think women are still second-class citizens? Yes I do! I’ve seen it all my life, I see it around me. But it’s not just feelings, it’s in the data. We’ve got a 20% pay gap, one in four women experiencing domestic violence, men outnumbering women two-to-one at all levels of government… I find it odd that every conversation about female equality starts with “haven’t you got enough?”  That survey did find more young women identifying as feminists… Yes, and that’s fabulous. It’s cheering to see attitudes toward the word feminism changing. I lived as a teenager through the late 80s and early 90s, the age of lad culture – Nuts and Zoo , the sudden acceptability of lap-dancing and strip clubs and banter. I think it set women’s liberation back a lot because there was this idea that you had to mould yourself around this very aggressive male model, and feminism was for whingers.  Do you think #MeToo galvanised young women? It’s done some really important things, one of which is to awaken an understanding that women standing side by side achieve more than if we just keep swallowing the lines fed to us by the self-help industry, such as that it’s on us as individuals to try harder to break down centuries of discrimination. The other important thing #MeToo has demonstrated is how quick vested interests are to trigger a backlash.",3,2018-09-23 23:47:12
163,1088,"I n the 1990s, in a special kind of civic carnival, council-owned tower blocks were garlanded with the banners of demolition contractors. Explosives were set. Crowds would then gather at a hopefully safe distance. There was anticipation, as before a firework display, until – kerplunk! – the former homes of hundreds descended like stumpy ballerinas into spreading skirts of dust. As the received wisdom was that tower blocks were a Bad Thing, there was little inhibition about celebrating their destruction.  Times change. The finishing touches are currently being applied to two blocks, 20 and 16 storeys high, commissioned by the London borough of Hackney, which was once an enthusiastic detonator of its own high-rise housing stock. There is a twist: the new towers contain flats for private sale, at prices from £600,000 to £ 2.95m , in order to fund the rebuilding of lower blocks of homes for council tenants. The building type considered intolerable for the latter now attracts premium prices for private buyers.  These two towers, part of the rebuilding of the Colville estate in Hoxton, are part of a programme of housing projects that has had Hackney council shortlisted by the Royal Institute of British Architects for their Client of the Year award . Hackney’s work is in turn part of the revival of council housing that has been gathering in recent years, especially in London boroughs such as Camden, Brent , Enfield, Newham and Croydon.  The stated aim of projects like the Colville estate is to replace poor-quality housing with new or refurbished homes, with the same numbers or more available at social rent, plus more at “intermediate” levels, which means schemes such as shared ownership, where residents buy shares of their flat – as much as they can afford – rather than the whole thing.

171,1096,"W hen Theresa May woke up on Friday morning to headlines speaking of her humiliation in Salzburg , it was not an entirely novel experience for a prime minister who has become synonymous with calamity. She has had many Catastrophic Fridays. And Miserable Mondays, Terrible Tuesdays, Wicked Wednesdays, Torrid Thursdays, Savage Saturdays and Searing Sundays.  One of the notable features of her premiership has been the extraordinary capacity of the human sponge at Number 10 to soak up pitiless batterings that would have crushed other politicians. One of Mrs May’s female colleagues in the cabinet recently offered me the opinion that any man in her tortured position would have long since thrown in the blood-soaked towel.  Even so, the Salzburg debacle was exceptionally ignominious for Mrs May, both politically and personally. She did not fly to Austria with the expectation that the EU leaders were going to fully embrace her Chequers proposal for the future relationship. She was not that delusional. The prime minister did think the EU would talk in language that was sufficiently friendly for her to be able to argue that Chequers was still viable and that might help her endure a difficult Tory party conference. The Chequers plan, already pretty friendless in parliament and unpopular with British voters, needed some warm words from the EU if it was to have a hope of staying airborne. Instead, she was shot down in flames.  This was in large part a failure, the latest in a sorry saga of them, of British negotiating tactics. In advance of the summit, Mrs May had sent cabinet ministers around European capitals in an effort to find allies. What London conceived of as a “charm offensive” was seen on the continent as an insulting attempt to drive wedges into the EU by trying to set member states against each other and against the commission’s negotiators. The belief that Britain can divide and conquer in the EU has been a persistent miscalculation on the part of its government. The effect has been to draw the EU closer together.  Things turned even more sour once the summit got under way in Salzburg. The hills were alive with the sound of other leaders becoming more and more irritated with the prime minister. Some were aggravated by Britain’s failure to produce fresh proposals to resolve the Irish border conundrum. Mrs May, whose emotional intelligence has never been terribly refined, did not help herself at the summit dinner by addressing them as if they were junior members of her cabinet rather than equals whose help she can’t do without. She presented her Chequers plan in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion that many in her audience found too aggressive. There was some incredulity around the table when she even started to read out bits of a newspaper article. Very well, they retorted, we will leave it. Donald Tusk , the European council president, said it clearly: the Chequers plan for selective participation in the single market “will not work” because it would undermine the integrity of the EU. This was not a new position. EU officials have been telling the British at all levels of engagement that Mrs May’s notion of a “common rulebook” for trade in goods is not viable and for a multiplicity of reasons. The EU has been saying this, just a bit more diplomatically than at Salzburg, for weeks. The only difference made by Mr Tusk was to spell it out in blunt language.  This exposed another persistent fantasy of the British government: that the EU does not really mean it when it says its “four freedoms” are non-negotiable. The EU has always been consistent in saying that it can’t compromise on this and for good reason. The single market (a British invention, incidentally) will start to unravel if members are allowed to cherrypick bits they like and leave aside those that don’t suit them so well. Even more would this be the case if a non-member, which is what Britain will be, was allowed to opt in and out as it pleased. Hence Mr Tusk’s Twitter joke about Mrs May being offered a cake with “no cherries”. The EU’s own internal fractures, not least on immigration, make it even less willing to countenance special privileges for Britain. Anxiety about its own cohesion, particularly felt by Emmanuel Macron, further militates against conceding anything that might look like a reward for leaving.  All of this has been clear since Britain embarked down this peril-strewn path. None of this should have been as large a shock as it was to Mrs May.",9,2018-09-23 23:47:46

173,1098,"W ho believes in the magic of self-organising, dynamic markets that never make mistakes? The crisis in British conservatism is that it is simultaneously a believer and non-believer. Just as it wants to be both out of Europe but in it, on its own terms, because that means prosperity and influence, so it proclaims undying fealty to markets while being forced to curb and intervene in them in practice. It turns the party into a political pantomime horse unfit to govern – and may ultimately force its break-up as the strains of the lived inconsistencies become intolerable.  For the dramas of Salzburg betray much deeper and profound intellectual conflicts. Theresa May’s ferociously anti-Europe wing of MPs is animated by a passionate belief in the precepts of US free-market libertarianism and sees Europe as the major intellectual and political obstacle. Last week, a group of British and US rightwing thinktanks published a blueprint for a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal.  Britain’s environmental and food standards regulation would be scrapped while our public sector would be opened up to be run by US companies, particularly in the NHS. The immigration system would be redrawn to favour free movement between the US and UK, to promote what they described as a new, free-market gold standard for trade deals. The state would be removed from the economy in an Anglo-American free market condominium, with the UK “regaining control” by becoming the 51st state but without any votes.  The British thinktanks, including the Initiative for Free Trade, whose president is the Eurosceptic Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, are outriders for the Tory Eurosceptic rightwing. The trade secretary, Liam Fox, is a keen advocate of such a deal, but he knows that to advocate scrapping food standards before Brexit would be political death. His colleague and fellow libertarian, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has ruled it out for just that reason.  For markets, even though neither Gove nor Fox wants openly to concede it, don’t work as the ideology predicts. Market economies need the state, European-style. Privatising the NHS via a US trade deal while allowing the free import of genetically modified US food would create a political backlash to make last May’s reaction to new rail timetables look tame.  On Thursday, hours before Mrs May’s confrontation with reality in Salzburg, the Office of Rail and Road published its assessment of how the railways, organised to simulate a market, were unable to co-ordinate the movement of trains. The result was hundreds of cancellations, huge delays and disruption for millions. Nobody, observed the report, in this botched, unco-ordinated market was in charge.  In response, Eurosceptic, market ideologist and transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had to announce a full-scale review of the rail system. He wanted the review to be minimalist, confining itself to potential tweaks to the franchise system, but he was forced to concede that its terms of reference should include extending public ownership. The rail market needs to have a central organising authority. Otherwise, the self-interest of different actors, supposedly a key driver of market efficiency, means the system collapses into mayhem. The truth is that there is a such an authority, even in the current degraded and dysfunctional system: it is the Department for Transport . Except that Grayling doesn’t want to exercise such public power, except when forced to. Strangely, he keeps being forced.  These truths should be no surprise. They are the cornerstone of Keynesian economics, so derided by the Eurosceptic right but whose virtues have been underscored by, first, the financial crisis and now successive problems in deregulated industries. Markets, including and especially financial markets, need central organising public authorities, otherwise they spin out of control. The policy challenge is not to abandon society to their working or to socialise them, but to harness their power for the common good. That means accepting a role for an activist state and making sure it has the agility, capacity and quality officials to deliver .  Importantly, the British public, at the receiving end of the experiment that has now lasted four decades, is beginning to side with a Keynesian and European world view. There are huge majorities emerging in favour of public ownership and against austerity – last week, for example, the National Centre for Social Research reported that only 4% of both Tory and Labour voters think that the government needs to implement further cuts. Meanwhile, support for more tax-and-spend policies is running at 60%, a figure that has doubled since 2010.  This is – or should be – Labour’s opportunity. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has begun to win intriguing plaudits for some of his ideas (including from Jim O’Neill, the former Treasury minister). These range from new forms of employee participation to reshaping the financial system. But they do not yet sit in a consistent social democratic world view incorporating our relations with Europe and are, above all, compromised by siding with the Eurosceptic right over Brexit.  The choice before the country is brutal. It is between the world heralded by the Anglo-American rightwing thinktanks or European liberal social democracy. Imagining, as Jeremy Corbyn and his circle seem to, that the argument will go away post Brexit, or if there is no second “people’s vote”, is self-deluding moonshine.  Making the argument for, say, a national investment bank, is suddenly easy. Integrating it into an argument for Europe is much tougher, but it’s what the left must do to be consistent, tap the new mood and win any general election. Changing Britain and halting Brexit are two sides of the same coin.  • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",9,2018-09-23 23:47:56

First, she is warm and inviting, when her smoky, melancholy records had led me to expect someone much more remote. And second, she is immediately in full swing with her impersonation of my English accent. “Life in the old dog yet, eh!” she says, after we decide to go to her room to avoid the noise and the smoking rules. “Good old Blighty!” she adds, as we get into the lift. I didn’t see this coming – not from a woman who grew up in the Deep South of the US, where she learned to sing about drunks and devils and depravity while dodging them, and has been dodging them ever since. I didn’t know she’d be funny.  “Aaaaand relax,” the 46-year-old says, sitting down on the rooftop balcony of her hotel room, after opening a bottle of red wine from the minibar and lighting cigarettes for us that she keeps in a leather pouch she bought in Mexico. As we talk, she tops up my glass but not her own, “I can get you drunk, but not me,” she says, because she has to go on stage tonight. If you’re a fan of Cat Power’s music, you might be thinking: “Well, hang on a minute, she was drunk the last time I saw her live, in fact she turned her back on the audience, muttered something inaudible, stopped in the middle of three songs and then walked off.” Such erraticism is indeed something her live shows became known for; in her own life there were psychotic breakdowns, and she went to rehab for alcohol and prescription-drug addiction.  Her diehard fans never wavered, though. For them, to know Cat Power’s heartbreaking, raw music is to love her unconditionally, giving her a rightfully elevated position in the American alt-rock scene, alongside contemporaries such as Sonic Youth and Will Oldham . Her blues singing and otherworldly coolness have also been noted by the fashion industry, with Karl Lagerfeld asking her to model Chanel jewellery after seeing her smoking a cigarette outside the Mercer Hotel in New York.  Currently, she is on a wave of rebirth, having changed record label, surprised her fans by becoming a mother, and realised her mind was never what others thought it was. Her new album is called Wanderer , she produced it herself, and it has already attracted excitement with its first single, Woman, a duet recorded with Lana Del Rey . One music website explained that the astonishment at their pairing was because Del Rey gets called out for being too fake, while Marshall gets questioned for being too real. But we’re not here to focus on the things that women are criticised for – this is Cat Power’s female solidarity album. She even has a Rihanna cover version on it, which came about after she heard it in a car – and hated it.",3,2018-09-23 23:47:59

179,1104,"A star of New York City Ballet and the co-founder of Dance Theatre of Harlem, Arthur Mitchell was also the first African American principal dancer in any major ballet company. Mitchell, who has died aged 84, had classical lines, buoyant energy and a palpable joy in movement.  In NYCB, where he danced from 1955 to 1968, he gained renown for two roles he created: the startlingly modernist Agon pas de deux , choreographed for him and Diana Adams by George Balanchine , and the mischievously bounding Puck in Balanchine’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream . According to his fellow NYCB dancer Jacques d’Amboise, “every time we toured Europe, he was a sensation … There would be hundreds of fans at the stage door.”  After Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968, Mitchell had his own dream, which was to form a top-notch ballet company that would shatter the myth that black bodies were not “right” for ballet. In a garage lent by the Harlem School of the Arts and with the support of his mentor Karel Shook (artistic director of Dutch National Ballet), he started a school. They left the doors open to attract young people from the street. To keep them there, Mitchell compared ballet to basketball, hired drummers instead of pianists to accompany the class, and allowed the students to wear jeans. Within four months, Dance Theatre of Harlem school had 800 students , and the professional company debuted in 1971 at the Guggenheim Museum.

183,1108,"A group of leading Indian artists, in Britain to help commemorate the end of the first world war, says it has uncovered evidence of historic racism involving the care of soldiers traumatised by their experiences.  Combatants from the Indian subcontinent, along with many of those from what were then described as “lower social orders”, were not officially recognised as suffering from shell shock – a syndrome that is now covered by the term post-traumatic stress disorder, they say.  The artists, from Delhi and known as Raqs Media Collective , said that original documents uncovered in the British Library revealed that the armed forces systematically neglected to treat psychological problems among Indian soldiers.  Shuddhabrata Sengupta of Raqs, who are creating an artwork in Colchester commissioned by the arts body 14-18 Now for the Essex town’s Firstsite arts venue , said that British commanding officers appeared to use both class and race to ration mental health care during recuperation periods. “The condition of shell shock was first diagnosed in 1915 by the English doctor Charles Meyers,” said Sengupta. “But documents we found in the British Library show Meyers quickly dropped the term because it was feared ordinary soldiers would find it easy to understand and so would ask to be seen by medics.  “Instead Meyers suggested a more opaque diagnosis of NYD, or Not Yet Diagnosed – Nervous, which ordinary soldiers would find harder to use.”  The term “trench back”, which features in the art collective’s new piece Not Yet At Ease , was often adopted to describe symptoms that were actually psychological.  “The idea of ‘trench back’ derived from the earlier condition of ‘railway back’, which was used for people who were thought to have been upset, or jolted, by the speed of rail travel,” said Sengupta. “It was a way of talking about wounds or damage to the spine, instead of mental health. Trench back was supposedly caused by being knocked by falling debris in the trenches.”  In the summer of 1915, Captain John D Sandes, the officer in charge of electrotherapy at the temporary Kitchener Indian Hospital set up in Brighton, described his diagnosis of trench back in the British Medical Journal : “In a certain proportion a pronounced psychical factor can be traced, and these cases present features similar in many respects to the condition known as ‘railway spine’ and are always difficult to treat.”  Further reports written by the chief censor of Indian military correspondence in France, Evelyn Berkeley Howell, chronicle the increasing depression suffered by Indian soldiers: “Many of the men show a tendency to break into poetry which I am inclined to regard as a rather ominous sign of mental disquietude. The number of letters written by men who have obviously given way to despair has also increased both absolutely and relatively.”  Sengupta believes that the art installation in Colchester is the first public admission of these dubious wartime diagnoses outside scholarly circles. He and his fellow artists have created a twisting complex of padded cells to represent the treatment cells in the first world war hospitals. “But they also follow the form of the trenches themselves, which were labyrinthine. We are also creating a palimpsest of sounds, including readings from these official reports and fragments of a novel, with film footage and photos,” he said.",9,2018-09-23 23:48:38

185,1110,"Hundreds of people have been killed or maimed by landmines in north-east Nigeria , research shows.  Mines laid by Boko Haram, the extremist group that has waged a deadly insurgency in the Lake Chad region, killed 162 people in two years and wounded 277 more, according to the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), a landmine clearance charity.  Casualties rose from 12 per month in 2016 to 19 per month in 2017-18, making Nigeria’s casualty rate from mines the eighth highest in the world.  After nine years of the insurgency, locally produced landmines, unexploded bombs and improvised explosive devices are scattered across the north-east.  “All around here people are dying. Just looking for firewood is very risky,” said Saleh Ibrahim, the deputy leader of a camp in Ngala, in Borno state, that shelters more than 100,000 people.  “Last November, five girls between eight and 17 years old found a metal ring on the ground. Two were young daughters of my sister. They thought it might be jewellery. One picked it up but it was linked to a bomb. They all died.”  MAG’s Avishek Banskota, who is based in Maiduguri, said: “Everyone I have met in Borno state has been affected in one way or the other, whether losing a family member, a friend or a house. People can’t move around freely in most of the region and much of the land can’t be used to farm or collect firewood, so the impact on communities is huge.”  According to the police, militants use pipes, pots and other items to make their own munitions and harvest explosives from undetonated ordnance. One officer said the militants tended to plant items in areas where they thought the army would visit, and also mined around their bases in remote areas.  Boko Haram splintered into several groups in 2016 but its factions still wield considerable power. Abubakar Shekau, the longtime leader of the group who pledged allegiance to Isis, was rejected by the latter in favour of Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of the group’s founder, possibly because Shekau had been targeting Muslim civilians. Barnawi’s faction is perceived to be primarily targeting Christians and the military, while Shekau’s indiscriminately abducts, rapes and kills.  However, there are indications that Barnawi’s group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), is becoming more extreme. Mamman Nur, a more moderate leader, was reportedly killed by his own men in August.  The MAG data suggests more mines have been laid in the south of the region, where Shekau’s group mostly operates, though the figures may be skewed as the north, where ISWAP operates, is less accessible.  The data may show only a fraction of the landmine problem. The military does not share information about how many mines it clears and refuses to allow access to much of Borno state. Humanitarian organisations are not allowed in areas not controlled by the military, and 900,000 people are thought to be stuck in these areas without adequate food or healthcare.  The Nigerian authorities have been sending thousands of people back to garrison towns in unsafe areas, where they run the risk of Boko Haram attacks, in an apparent attempt to show they have secured the north-east before next year’s presidential election. Many of those who have returned have regrets. Some are not even originally from the areas to which they are moving.  It is unclear at what rate Boko Haram is still laying mines. This month the military bombed what it described as an IED factory in Guzumala.  MAG is launching a campaign to raise awareness of the landmine situation in Nigeria. “Despite hundreds of people being recently killed or injured by landmines in Nigeria, the issue has largely gone under the radar,” said Chris Loughran, the organisation’s director of policy and advocacy.  “We are writing to Kate Osamor, the chair of the UK’s parliamentary group for Nigeria, asking her to make a statement in the House of Commons urgently calling for this new landmine crisis to be included as a humanitarian response priority by the international community.”",3,2018-09-23 23:48:46

187,1112,"Warnings about the dangers of global warming are being watered down in the final version of a key climate report for a major international meeting next month, according to reviewers who have studied earlier versions of the report and its summary.  They say scientists working on the final draft of the summary are censoring their own warnings and “pulling their punches” to make policy recommendations seem more palatable to countries – such as the US, Saudi Arabia and Australia – that are reluctant to cut fossil-fuel emissions, a key cause of global warming. “Downplaying the worst impacts of climate change has led the scientific authors to omit crucial information from the summary for policymakers,” said one reviewer, Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  “However, if governments do not recognise the full scale and urgency of the risks, they may underestimate how critical it is to meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. And that could have very serious knock-on effects in the battle to limit the impact of global warming.”  The Special Report o n Global Warming of 1.5C and its summary for policymakers were commissioned by governments following the UN meeting in Paris in 2015, when it was agreed to act to limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to try keep that increase nearer to 1.5C.  The report – to be presented at a meeting in Korea in early October – will make clear that allowing temperatures to rise by 2C will have devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, spreading deserts, loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice-caps and increases in the number of devastating storms.  However, it is the report’s summary for policymakers that is causing concern. This is the document politicians will use as a key climate guide when making changes to legislation. Reviewers of earlier drafts say it is being altered to make the dangers of climate change seem less alarming. As a result, they say,, policymakers could seriously underestimate the risks of global warming. Cuts made to the final draft of the summary include:  • Any mention that temperature rises of above 1.5C could lead to increased migrations and conflict;  • All discussion of the danger of the Gulf Stream being disrupted by cold water flowing from the Arctic where more and more sea-ice is melting;  • Warnings about the dangers that 1.5–2C temperature rises could trigger irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet and raise sea levels by 1–2 metres over the next two centuries.  Other cuts from the summary include the sentence: “Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1C) and are expected to increase in many populations as average global temperatures increase from 1C to 1.5C and beyond.”  The original summary also stated “at 2C warming, there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics”. Again this is not mentioned in the report for policymakers. “The scientists who produce reports like these try to summarise the latest knowledge, but they have a reputation for being conservative about the worst risks of climate change,” Ward said. “This time they have outdone themselves in pulling their punches, however.”  An IPCC spokesman said member governments would work to ensure the summary for policymakers was consistent with the findings in the main report. “They may change the wording of text there to clarify, remove material from the summary for policymakers, or bring material from the main report that was not there at the start of the session. Any text in the summary for policymakers … is based on the assessment in the main report. Even if it is removed from the summary for policymakers, the finding it is based on remains in the main report.”",9,2018-09-23 23:48:57

Casual in front of the dramatic backdrop of a soaring Brooklyn Bridge, the young women straggle and chat, drag their skateboards, scroll on their phones, discuss what they’re going to do after this. “I’m gonna skate across the bridge,” says Nina Moran, 20. “It’s too hot!” says Ardelia “Dede” Lovelace, 20. “It’s my birthday today,” says Rachelle Vinberg (she’s turning 20). “I forgot until my mom called me. What am I doing to celebrate? I want to go for a run.”  “Oh, it’s always like herding cats,” says Crystal Moselle. Moselle is the director of the Sundance-breakout Skate Kitchen , a coming-of-age film about an all-female New York skateboarding collective so closely based on the lives of the girls it features that it seems more like documentary than fiction. The lines are very blurred.  Moselle was drawn to the group initially because of how they looked. She spotted Moran and Vinberg on the subway and approached them because of Moran’s noisy charisma and because it was so unusual to see young women with skateboards. “I took them for coffee,” she says. “Which they were really excited about, because they’d never been to coffee with an adult before.” Moselle’s first feature, The Wolfpack , which won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance festival in 2015, was a documentary about an extraordinary New York family of boys, the Angulo brothers, kept away from society by their father. In that case, too, Moselle just happened upon them: she saw the brothers walking on the street, and chased after them because they looked so unusual (they were dressed like the characters from Reservoir Dogs ). The Wolfpack , as the title implies, was about the family group. Similarly, Skate Kitchen is about a crew: the friendship group of young women that Moselle met through Moran and Vinberg. “There’s something about the ensemble that I really love,” says Moselle. “How an individual works within that.”",3,2018-09-23 23:49:07

Having healthy social networks, on the other hand, can decrease risk of mortality and of developing diseases, as well as helping people recover when they are ill – and with 9 million adults describing themselves as “often or always lonely”, it is clear that loneliness has become such a pressing public health concern. Recognising the impact loneliness could have on you is the first step to tackling it.  Work out exactly why you are lonely  The mental health charity Mind cites two main factors that can cause loneliness: someone either not having enough basic social contact or, despite being surrounded by people, not feeling understood, listened to or cared for. It suggests working out which profile fits you best – it could give you a better idea of how to work through your feelings of loneliness.  Speak to someone",9,2018-09-23 23:49:32

197,1181,"Stuart Findlay’s late header secured 2-1 home victory for Kilmarnock against Celtic in their Scottish Premiership match while Rangers swept St Johnstone aside 5-1 at Ibrox.  Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic a 1-0 first-half lead after Kirk Broadfoot failed to clear Kieran Tierney’s cross after 34 minutes. Greg Taylor hit the post before the Scotland striker found the net with a close-range diving header. Dedryck Boyata came close to adding a second soon afterwards but Jamie MacDonald parried his effort over the bar.  Chris Burke equalised for Killie just after the hour with his long-range strike going in off the post. The away side continued to push for a second goal and MacDonald impressed with a one-handed save to keep Lewis Morgan’s effort out.  But Celtic were sent home pointless after Killie pounced in the third minute of added time. The former Celtic youth player headed Burke’s corner into the bottom corner to hand Kilmarnock maximum points.  Afterwards Brendan Rodgers admitted he is facing the biggest test of his Celtic tenure in what is their worst start to a Premiership season in 20 years. After six games the champions have only 10 points and are six points behind the leaders, Hearts, their poorest start since the 1998-99 campaign under Jozef Venglos.  “It’s a challenge,” he said. “We have to accept that. There’s no doubt we need to be better. When you’re at the biggest clubs and you don’t win, the heat comes on to you. That’s when you show you’re a Celtic player, manager, member of staff. You come together. When you lose games, the spotlight will always be on you. You have to work hard, do the basics right. The basics cost us this time.”  Killie have now gone four games without defeat by Celtic and their manager, Steve Clarke, praised Findlay, the former Parkhead youth player, for playing through the pain barrier. “He didn’t train all week but he put his body on the line,” said Clarke. “He was struggling at half-time but those are some of the rewards the footballing Gods give you.  “Stuart had a bang on the knee and it was sore through the week. He got another bang in the first half but we’ve got good character in the squad. We spoke at half-time about believing. We’ve shown we can compete with the big teams. Second half we competed well and deserved to get back in.”",9,2018-09-23 23:49:38
198,1182,"D owning Street is war-gaming a snap general election. The Sunday papers are alive with stories that Theresa May is weighing up the possibility of seeking public support for her Brexit strategy. Voters could soon be trooping off to polling stations to elect a government for the third time in little more than three years.  Given the disastrous result the last time the prime minister went down this route, it seems likely that May would only call a general election as a last resort. That said, the events of the past week mean that anything could happen.  Labour is aware of that and will now be kicking itself that it spent the summer embroiled in an internal row about antisemitism rather than devoting all its attention to formulating policies and selling them to the public.  The need to reach outwards is particularly important when your policy proposals are radical and the public mood is cynical, yet it was telling that Andrew Marr spent a lot more time on his BBC TV show questioning Jeremy Corbyn about racism than he did about what a Labour government would do in office.  Labour’s approach to economic policy has changed fundamentally since the days when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown accepted much of the Thatcherite settlement, thinking the idea was to make markets more efficient and fairer. But Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell , believe there is something structurally wrong with UK capitalism that needs to be fixed.  In that respect, it is right to say that Corbyn and McDonnell want to turn the clock back to the 1970s and the analysis that underpinned Tony Benn’s Alternative Economic Strategy (AES) , the thrust of which was that curing Britain’s economic problems was a supply-side matter that necessarily involved more than simply pumping up demand.  Reflation was part of the original AES, but it also included public ownership, economic planning, import controls, industrial democracy, price controls and hostility to what was then called the European Economic Community. This was the pre-globalisation era, but even back then supporters of the AES said multinational companies were gouging consumers through excessive prices, shifting jobs overseas and using transfer pricing to avoid paying UK tax.  The similarities with current Labour economic policy are obvious. Certainly, McDonnell would end austerity and increase public spending. But, as with the AES in the 1970s, the critique goes deeper. Put simply, the financial crisis of a decade ago exposed deep flaws in the UK’s economic model that have manifested themselves in low investment, weak productivity, a shrunken manufacturing base and a chronic trade deficit.  McDonnell’s remedy is consistent with that diagnosis. He has pledged to balance the government’s current spending, with any increases in day-to-day outlays on things such as public sector pay matched by increases in taxes on the richest 5% of voters and higher corporation tax. There would, though, be extra borrowing to pay for £250bn of public investment over 10 years and funding for a national investment bank.  To an extent, this leaves Labour at the mercy of the financial markets. If the City takes fright at McDonnell’s plans, the result will be that he will have to pay higher interest rates for his extra borrowing, with a dampening impact on growth. This argument – that public borrowing inevitably crowds out private investment – looks less compelling in the light of the massive increase in the budget deficit during and after the financial crisis, which occurred without any significant change to the interest rate paid on government bonds.",9,2018-09-23 23:49:45
199,1183,"B y the time the 130,000 regular readers of the New York Review of Books picked up their new copy of the literary journal last week, the cover story had already cost the editor Ian Buruma his job . In a spectacularly ill-judged essay, the Canadian former radio presenter Jian Ghomeshi provided a lengthy reflection on all the bad things that had happened to him as a result of allegations arising out of his behaviour towards women.  Incredulous and angry that the NYRB would provide a platform for public rehabilitation of an alleged sexual abuser, journalists and subscribers expressed anger and dismay at the publication. Seemingly unable to stop digging, Buruma responded to the criticism through an interview with Slate’s Isaac Chotiner in which he demonstrated an embarrassingly shaky grasp of the background to Ghomeshi’s story. The quote that ricocheted around the web showed a cringeworthy lack of awareness about how the story was perceived “The exact nature of his behaviour – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern,” said Buruma. And with that, he was gone.  Journalists are meant to be experts in context, in joining the dots between facts and circumstance and synthesising them into, if not teachable moments, then certainly saleable narratives and thoughtful analysis.  It is very difficult to imagine what would have made publishing a “Fall of Men” edition of the NYRB at this particular moment more acceptable. Maybe if John Hockenberry, another radio presenter who lost his job over allegations of sexual harassment, had not been featured in an identikit essay in Harper’s that week; maybe if the NYRB essay had been fact-checked or just better written; maybe if the women involved with Ghomeshi had been consulted, or the internet had never been invented, then Buruma would still be in post.  His own analysis of the situation was that he had been “convicted on Twitter”. He told the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland: “As editor of the New York Review of Books, I published a theme issue about #MeToo-offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I, myself, am publicly pilloried.”",3,2018-09-23 23:49:48
200,1184,"I was once forced to take a personality test by a boss who had read that they were a valuable source of managerial insight, or some such nonsense. Weirdly, it didn’t go well. After wasting my time answering multiple-choice questions such as, “Do you hate wasting your time?”, I received a laminated report informing me: “You rarely see the need to be modest about your own achievements and have a high opinion of your own abilities.” Which is ridiculous because I am the most modest person I know. And I know a lot of people.  Anyway, my former employer isn’t the only one with a misguided passion for personality tests. Despite there being no scientific evidence to back them up (many scientists consider them to be the business-bro equivalent of horoscopes), personality tests are all the rage in the corporate world, where they are used as a guide in hiring or assembling more effective teams.  The gold standard of personality tests is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which divides people into 16 types, depending on their self-reported preferences for things such as extroversion or introversion. The MBTI has been around since the 1960s, and an estimated two million people take it every year, a lot of whom seem to be management consultants; the test reportedly exerts considerable influence at McKinsey . I know, it is hard to believe that management consultants would be enamoured of pseudo-scientific BS, but there you go.  Apologies for the snark. I’m an Aries; I can’t help it – it takes us a while to get to the point. If you’re an ENFP (outgoing and creative) on the MBTI, you will be glad to know that I have now reached my point – which is that time may finally be up for Myers-Briggs. Researchers at Northwestern University have just published what they believe to be the first scientifically sound approach to personality classification. “Personality types only existed in self-help literature and did not have a place in scientific journals,” one of the researchers announced. “This will change because of this study.”  What makes this new study so great, apparently, is the volume of data; the researchers analysed questionnaires from more than 1.5 million people. They then ran algorithms and produced lots of graphs. From this they concluded that there are four main personality types: you’re either a Samantha, a Carrie, a Miranda, or a Charlotte. Just kidding! Sorry, couldn’t help my inner Miranda coming out. No, according to this very serious study, your personality is either: Average, Reserved, Self-Centred, or a Role Model. Apparently “young males are overrepresented in the Self-Centred group, while females over 15 years old are vastly underrepresented”. Meanwhile, the most common personality type is Average, which is defined as being “high in neuroticism and extroversion, while low in openness”. In conclusion: most of us are pretty terrible people. I’m not sure the researchers had to do a study to find that out, they could have just looked at Twitter.  I don’t want to tell these academics how to do their job, but they have completely misunderstood the point of personality tests. Nobody cares if a personality test is scientific or not. We love them because they cater to our narcissism and our need to belong; they make us feel normal and special at the same time. No one wants to spend 15 minutes answering questions only to find out they are Average. Or is that Self-Centred?  Why do lesbians love cats?  I recently realised that I have achieved something quite amazing: I have never dated anyone who owns a cat. The reason this is amazing is because I’ve mainly dated women, and we all know queers love their cats. This isn’t just a stereotype, by the way, there is data to prove it. Autostraddle, an online magazine for LBT women, recently published the results of its 2018 Lesbian Stereotypes Survey . As a dog person, it pains me to say this, but there seems to be firm evidence that most of my fellow gays go to bat for cats. Particularly in Australia, for some reason.  So why do girls who like girls like cats so much? Please remove the obvious smutty joke from your head; this is a serious sociological discussion we’re having here. Well, first of all, it should be said that you should take these cat-stats with a pinch of salt. As Autostraddle noted, “a queer woman in possession of a cat is exactly the type of person who would want to take a survey about lesbian stereotypes” in the first place.  With that caveat in place, Autostraddle considered the theory that cat-loving tends to be thought of as a female trait, and lesbians tend to be female. After musing a while on the matter, however, this theory was quickly nixed. Despite all the cliches about women and cats, it seems cats have conquered the petriarchy. According to a study from the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association , more than two-thirds of cat owners in the UK are now men. The researchers suggested celebrity cat-owners such as Ed Sheeran may be behind the trend. I rather like this explanation as it chimes with my own personal motto: “When in doubt, blame Ed Sheeran.”  Russians will do anything for free pizza  Russians are famous for their love of Salisbury cathedral and, it would appear, their knack for ill-advised fast-food campaigns. Earlier this year an online backlash forced Burger King’s Russian division to pull a promotion that offered women a lifetime supply of Whoppers if they got impregnated by football players competing in the World Cup. Now a Domino’s Pizza franchise has abruptly ended a deal offering free pizza for life to anyone who got the company’s logo tattooed on them. The promotion was supposed to run for two months, but 381 people branded themselves with Domino’s logos in just four days, forcing the franchise to end the promotion before they were bled dry.",9,2018-09-23 23:49:50

204,1209,"Chelsea , for the first time under Maurizio Sarri, have blinked. Their pristine record was checked across the capital, the visitors running aground on West Ham United’s industry on a day when Eden Hazard’s flicks and darts into space did not quite come off, the monopoly of possession did not translate into drive through midfield, and the crosses lofted into the middle tended to find N’Golo Kanté, at 5ft 6in, rather than the towering Olivier Giroud.  It all felt rather forced and awkward, an occasion to leave the Italian grumbling in frustration. Maybe that delayed flight back from Thessaloniki, pushed back 12 hours to land on Friday afternoon, had left them jaded after Europa League exertion s. Certainly they lacked the guile to disrupt a resolute West Ham side who were effectively and efficiently organised by Declan Rice, the teenager who had spent seven years at Chelsea’s youth academy and sat in front of a rugged back four with tenacious teammates contributing eagerly at his side.  Manuel Pellegrini’s hosts will have taken huge heart from making life so uncomfortable for a team who had started the weekend atop the table. Yet they might have claimed more than a mere point given that they had prised out the better chances, as rare as they were, amid their huff and puff. None was more appealing than the one that came 13 minutes from time as the substitute Robert Snodgrass swung over a cross from the left that found Andriy Yarmolenko, free beyond a distracted Marcos Alonso at the back post. The winger, summoning his best Mamadou Sakho impression , somehow headed wide to the disbelief of the majority in the stadium. That the Ukrainian was later awarded the sponsors’ man of the match award felt rather curious.  In that context, and considering the chances passed up by Michail Antonio in the first half, Chelsea’s point might actually be considered a bonus. Yet the frantic nature of their late push for a winner betrayed the reality that this was a wasted opportunity. Perhaps it all served to justify Sarri’s consistently downbeat assessment of his team’s title chances this term, reiterated in the aftermath of Sunday’s stalemate. It only takes Chelsea, and Hazard, to be slightly off colour to leave them looking flawed as challengers to Liverpool and Manchester City. They are a good team with some exceptional individuals but still a work in progress, a team in need of time to develop.  Hazard’s display summed it up. Where he has been offered space in recent weeks to exploit behind a front man, he has thrived. Here he was crowded out on the left flank and, invariably, by Rice when he drifted centrally. Pellegrini admitted his gameplan had been to funnel Chelsea down their right rather than left, where Hazard and Alonso have been their most potent attackers this term. It proved successful until the Belgian swapped wings for the fraught latter stages and finally found some joy – though by then desperation was prompting overelaboration. When offered his clearest sight of goal, he chose to backheel in the hope of finding a teammate.  If he is shackled, or simply not at his spritely best – he had missed the midweek game because of fatigue, after all – then the group appear diminished. They control the ball comfortably enough, as illustrated by Jorginho’s club-record pass completion tally in midfield, but the threat came only in fits and starts with Giroud swamped and peripheral. Álvaro Morata, striking Lukasz Fabianski in the face with a close-range flick, and Ross Barkley injected urgency late on. Sarri bemoaned an inability to move the ball quicker.  The satisfaction should have been West Ham’s, and they would have celebrated their point more wholeheartedly had they not passed up clearcut chances themselves. How they cursed the absence of the injured Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernández. Yarmolenko’s miss was the most mind-boggling, but Antonio, standing in at centre-forward, might have scored twice around the half-hour mark. First Felipe Anderson spun away from César Azpilicueta and slipped a pass beyond a backtracking Antonio Rüdiger – who would later retire hamstrung – which sent Antonio through only for the striker to clip the angle of post and bar with his shot.  Moments later Rice exploited Alonso’s desire to push upfield by clipping a pass into the space vacated by the Spaniard, on to which Yarmolenko tore. The Ukrainian drove at David Luiz with the ball eventually running through to Antonio, in the six-yard box, but Kepa blocked his shot from point-blank range.  “When you have such clear chances against a big team, you must score at least one of them,” said Pellegrini. “You must score.”  West Ham did not, but a first clean sheet of term was still something to be cherished. Their improvement is under way.",9,2018-09-23 23:50:05
205,1218,"The crisis engulfing the criminal justice system over its approach to rape cases is revealed by startling figures that show less than a third of prosecutions brought against young men result in a conviction.  According to statistics, men aged 18 to 24 in England and Wales are consistently less likely to be found guilty than older men on trial. Young men accounted for more than a quarter of defendants in rape-only cases in the five years to 2017-18.  The findings are the first in the Guardian’s series focusing on rape, which is consistently one of the most contentious and sensitive issues facing the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).  Senior CPS staff believe the failure to secure convictions reflects a desperate need to educate jurors, who appear particularly reluctant to punish young men at the start of their adult life for serious sexual assaults.  The figures highlighting the disparities are set out in a freedom of information request released by the CPS to the Labour MP Ann Coffey.  They cover a five-year period and highlight how difficult it is to secure successful prosecutions of men under the age of 25.  According to the figures:   The conviction rate last year in rape only trials involving 18- to 24-year-old men was 32% – the lowest of any age group. The number of successful prosecutions against men aged 25-59 was much higher – at 46 %.  In the past five years, the conviction rate for 18- to 24-year-old men who stood trial has not risen above a third. Of the 1,343 rape cases the CPS has taken against young men, only 404 were were convicted – an average of 30%.  The conviction rate for 18- to 24-year-olds in all rape cases – including those involving child abuse and domestic abuse – stood at 35% in the five years to 2017-18. However, the conviction rate in the same types of cases for men aged 25-59 was significantly higher – 49%.    chart   The figures cast doubt on the ability of juries to provide equal access to justice for all rape complainants, regardless of the age of their alleged attacker, according to experts and campaigners.  Coffey, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults, said the figures were a symptom of a much wider problem. “The vast majority of rape victims choose not to report to the police,” she said. “One significant reason for this is fear of not being believed. Everybody should be concerned that young women are not getting access to justice. This brings the whole justice system into disrepute.”  Coffey said the figures suggested a “reluctance on the part of juries to find young men guilty of date rape”.  “This may reflect the prevailing attitudes of society and therefore juries to women, who are often blamed for putting themselves in risky situations,” she said. “Juries seem to view evidence through the lens of stereotypes.  “There is still a dominance of rape myths in our culture, including that a woman who has drunk a lot cannot complain if she ends up being raped or that it is only rape if someone has injuries.”   chart 2   An intense media focus on the small number of false allegations of rape “perpetuates the public perception that lying about rape is common when in fact the opposite is true”, she added.  Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England and adviser to the Welsh government on violence against women, said the complainants in trials with younger defendants were also likely to be younger.  “Juries are told, rightfully, that you have to find not guilty if you are not sure and the perception is that the younger the victim is are the less believable you are,” he said. “Also, in my experience, juries are more likely to make allowances for a defendant the younger he is, this idea that he may not have known what he was doing at 24, but if he was older than that he does.”  Dr Dominic Willmott from the University of Huddersfield, who has carried out extensive research into jury bias in sexual offence cases, said the figures were shocking but not surprising.  “Scientific research shows us quite clearly that jurors are simply less willing to convict young defendants of rape for fear of the consequences such a ‘rapist’ label will have on their future,” he said.  Wilmott said his research showed jurors regularly believed defendants in this age category were guilty of rape as defined by the law, but were unwilling to convict and label a young man a rapist.",3,2018-09-23 23:50:12

209,1222,"Sport England is launching a £13.5m scheme to train 17,000 teachers in delivering PE and sport in school, after research found that almost 20% of secondary students hated PE lessons.  With more than a quarter of the nation’s adults “inactive”, according to the Active Lives survey released in March , Sport England wants to ensure students are leaving secondary education with an active lifestyle.  Jennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: “While some youngsters have a great experience of PE and sport at school, others don’t, and our research shows that can put them off being active for life. Lots of people have bad memories of being picked last for a team or just feeling really uncomfortable in PE lessons. This programme is designed to stop that happening.”  The scheme will run through the national network of teaching school alliances, training teachers in new activities from zumba to volleyball and encouraging school leaders to value PE.  Last year the government doubled the funding for PE in primary schools to £320m a year, and 1 million primary school children are now taking part in the Daily Mile running programme, but secondary schools have been without any financial investment or national schemes in the subject for the last decade.  A third of pupils leaving primary school are overweight or obese , making it more difficult for secondary school PE teachers to ensure their lessons are inclusive.  Meanwhile, schools are under greater pressure than ever to perform in academic subjects, and a Youth Sport Trust survey found that 38% of teachers said PE time had been cut for 14- to 16-year-olds in the past five years.  The former Olympic sprinter Darren Campbell, whose company works in schools , said there was a link between sport and mental health. “Competitive sport is being taken away and it’s becoming all about taking part,” he said. “Life is competitive, just getting a job is competitive. Sport is life lessons, learning how to win and learning how to deal with defeat. We’re failing to prepare young people for disappointment.”  Another Olympian, Denise Lewis, welcomed the focus on how teachers delivered PE lessons but expressed concern about what she saw while visiting schools.  “The lack of coordination in young people is alarming. I’ve been to schools where children aged nine and 10 just can’t skip,” she said. “It’s great they’re addressing secondary school PE but I still believe that by the time children are in year 6, if they are fitter and more coordinated, they will be more readily keen to participate in exercise at secondary school.”  Lewis also highlighted an issue facing teenage girls. “Most girls I see don’t have the correct fitting bras. They’re conscious of their shape while they’re participating in exercise, so they don’t commit fully. They’re participating with the handbrake on because they’re so self-conscious about their body.”  She said teachers needed to consider innovative and sensitive ways to support parents in providing appropriate kit.  Ross Myhill, the head of PE at Thomas Gainsborough school in Suffolk, one of 40 taking part in a pilot scheme, described the impact it was having, from training teachers to deliver activities such as yoga and handball to making the most of existing facilities through additional after-school clubs.  The school is running inclusive competitions for lower-ability students, such as a “Highland Games-style” sports day with welly throwing and tug of war. “These are students who have never represented the school [in sport] in their whole lives. They get to experience that same sense of pride, and competition,” Myhill said.  “I’ve been teaching for 15 years and I don’t think there’s been such a hands-on scheme before. You have up to £20k to upskill staff to give secondary school students more opportunities and get them active.  “We’ve got a rock climbing wall in school but – and it’s horrible to say it – we don’t have enough money in the school to be able to put people on a rock climbing course to deliver the lessons.”  With the new funding, Myhill hopes to be able to offer lunchtime and after-school sessions, as well as opening up the facility to the local community.",3,2018-09-23 23:50:27

But looking beyond the UK, it seems that tourist destinations around the world – however majestic – have long been afflicted with finicky visitor reviews. In 2014, one TripAdvisor reviewer (the aptly named GrimTraveller) left a one-star review of the UK’s highest mountain, Ben Nevis, describing it as “‘very steep and too high”. “The climb basically went on for far too long,” GrimTraveller wrote. “The long walk back down was boring and again took too long ... this attraction is free but I can’t imagine anyone – and I mean anyone – paying to climb this.”  Another reviewer on the site described the Grand Canyon as “nothing special” while one dismissed the Sydney Opera House as a “silly damned egg carton”.  In fact, nowhere in the world seems to be above a one-star review on TripAdvisor. One visitor to the Louvre – who explained they had finally made it to the Parisian gallery after 30 years – described it as: “Not very interesting at all.”  A past survey of travel agents by Thomas Cook and Abta revealed more tourist complaints. “On my holiday to Goa in India, I was disgusted to find that almost every restaurant served curry. I don’t like spicy food at all,” said one. “Topless sunbathing on the beach should be banned. The holiday was ruined, as my husband spent all day looking at other women,” said another.  Beaches do seem to prove troublesome. One holidaymaker reportedly complained that: “The sand was not like the sand in the brochure,” while another said: “The beach was too sandy.” It all raises the question: why ever leave the house?",10,2018-09-23 23:50:41
214,1227,"Alexandre Lacazette scored a beauty, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made the points safe and Unai Emery could toast a fourth consecutive Premier League win. Yet this was an afternoon when the margins were fine and the result could just as easily have gone the other way if Everton had turned up with their shooting boots on.  Petr Cech was the star turn and Emery’s decision to persist with the goalkeeper ahead of the summer signing, Bernd Leno, was more than vindicated. Cech made five stops in the first half that ranked from decent to excellent and, more than anyone, it was the 36-year-old who created the platform for victory. He went on to save brilliantly from Michael Keane at 2-0 and again from the substitute, Cenk Tosun, to ensure a first clean sheet of the Emery era. Everton felt chiefly frustration and not only because Aubameyang’s goal that killed the game ought to have been disallowed for offside. It was not even a borderline call. The Arsenal forward was a full yard in front of Jonjoe Kenny, the last defender.  The visitors had been the better team before the break and, on another day and against another goalkeeper, they might have been comfortably in front. The positive aspect for the manager, Marco Silva, was the fluency his players showed and how, initially, they knocked Arsenal from their stride. There was little wrong with his gameplan. The bad news was that it was not the first time Silva’s players had been guilty of profligacy; it was a similar story in the home defeat by West Ham last weekend. Everton have taken six points from their opening six fixtures and this was their 21st defeat in 25 visits to Arsenal. They have drawn the other four.  It was noticeable to see the Emirates Stadium was pockmarked by empty seats, particularly in the middle and upper tiers, and the atmosphere could best be described as subdued for long spells. Nobody quite knows what to make of this Arsenal team yet; they are waiting to judge them.  There was the sense of square pegs in round holes, with Aubameyang shoehorned in on the left and Mesut Özil stationed on the right – and struggling to suppress the urge to drift inside. The natural width must come from the full-backs Héctor Bellerín and Nacho Monreal.  There were times when Arsenal lacked imagination but it would turn out well enough after Lacazette had turned the contest on its head. The irony was that – wonderful finish aside – the centre-forward was peripheral and Emery admitted afterwards he was about to substitute him when he scored. Alex Iwobi was stripped and ready. Everton were more coherent in the first half, more threatening – particularly through Richarlison – while their pressing panicked an Arsenal defence in which Shkodran Mustafi endured a couple of wobbles and Sokratis Papastathopoulos was forced off with a knee injury.",9,2018-09-23 23:50:44
215,1228," A nthony Joshua is quietly adamant Deontay Wilder should be his 23rd opponent, at Wembley Stadium on 13 April, a date when sanity would have at least a chance to intrude briefly on the fight game with the crowning of a heavyweight regarded as the undisputed world champion.  The slender odds are that the IBF, WBA and WBO title-holder – who has an iron grip on the direction of his career – will get what he wants, mainly because Wilder, who holds the WBC belt, wants it too. However, trusting professional boxing to move along logical lines is the sporting equivalent of predicting what happens to Brexit.  After the storm on Saturday night at Wembley – where Joshua retained his belts by repelling a determined challenge from Alexander Povetkin before stopping the Russian emphatically in the seventh round – came the inevitable clamour.

216,1229,"The match had been billed as the battle of the fly-halves but in truth it was never really a contest. Owen Farrell comfortably outshone Danny Cipriani in their personal duel but, thanks to the performance of his dominant forwards – led by the relentless Maro Itoje – he had considerable help. Eddie Jones was not just being complimentary when he described Cipriani as “superman” last week but even the caped crusader could not hold back a tide as strong as this.  As Cipriani did not play particularly badly, so Farrell was not flawless, his goalkicking aside. There were a couple of uncharacteristically loose passes but anyone in attendance eager to see Cipriani make a mockery of his England snub by upstaging the Saracens fly-half left disappointed.  “Danny has had setbacks in his life before, otherwise he would be constantly in the England squad,” the Gloucester head coach, Johan Ackermann, said. “The good thing is he is an experienced player; he has experienced the disappointment before.”  Jones claimed Cipriani was a player best suited to a highlights reel last week but, save for a line break early in the second half and an assist for Mark Atkinson’s consolation try, there was little of note on show. Farrell’s would be more worth a watch, provided it included the lambasting he gave David Strettle for showing a moment’s hesitation when chasing his grubber. It remains to be seen if Jones intends to move him from inside-centre to fly-half for England but Mark McCall is in no doubt as to his quality when wearing No 10.  “He was incredibly influential,” the Saracens director of rugby said. “It wasn’t just his skill set, his passing and kicking. The physical tone that he set was incredible. Vocally he’s off the charts as well. He’s just this incredible player who adds in every way.”  Jones, with an England camp to prepare, was not in attendance but missed little he did not already know. Nine Saracens players were due in Bristol on Sunday night and on this evidence one could make the case for one or two more. This was a reminder of Saracens’ forward power against a Gloucester side who, while upwardly mobile, were given a harsh dose of reality.  Itoje was deployed at blindside flanker – McCall’s take on which row he plays in was a pithy “it doesn’t matter” – and, while there was the occasional lapse in discipline, he was colossal. “He’s a guy in a hurry to be better,” McCall said. “He’s been good all season and today he was great again.”  Along with Itoje, Mako Vunipola impressed, as did George Kruis and Michael Rhodes in the No 7 jersey and together they laid the platform for Saracens’ fourth consecutive bonus-point victory this season. It puts them top and, including the back end of last season, it is the 10th match in a row they have managed four or more tries – a Premiership record on the same day Richard Wigglesworth set his own for 266 appearances in the competition.  With the wind at their backs, Saracens raced into a 24-3 lead at half-time – Itoje scoring two tries, Strettle the other – while Sean Maitland and Alex Lozowski added two more after the break. Saracens have been a little slow to move through the gears this season but here their forwards were in overdrive against Gloucester, unbeaten in their first three matches.",9,2018-09-23 23:50:49

218,1231,"L abour’s Brexit policy so far could be described as giving the Tories enough rope to hang themselves. Keir Starmer’s six tests – demanding from any deal the exact same benefits that Britain has under EU membership – have bound Labour into opposing any endgame that damages what the Labour movement stands for: secure jobs, decent wages, world-class public services, migrant rights, national security and international solidarity.  The tests have been sensible policy during the negotiations, but their usefulness is quickly running out. The day approaches when Labour will be obliged to vote down the EU withdrawal deal in parliament, both for the country’s interests and for its own electoral prospects.  The Salzburg EU summit last week again reiterated that the other 27 governments will not move on the four freedoms of the single European market. They have been consistent that the four freedoms – of goods, services, capital and labour – must be accepted in full if the UK wants access to the single market. Theresa May has wasted two years and left the UK all the weaker for it.  May has also ignored parliament. There is no majority for any potential Brexit conclusion, including Chequers, no deal, the European Economic Area or the deal we currently have (membership of the EU with significant opt-outs). If May had hoped to limp to March and pass the final hurdle with a blind Brexit, leaving the hard choices to the transition period, that option too has been killed off by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.",3,2018-09-23 23:50:58

221,1234,"Consumer champion Martin Lewis has condemned as “outrageous” comments made by the Barclays chairman, John McFarlane, that claims for payment protection insurance compensation have turned many Britons into fraudsters.  McFarlane, who has worked in banking for more than 40 years, said a huge proportion of compensation claims were fraudulent and that the PPI claims culture suited the government by fuelling consumer spending on flat-screen TVs.  “The percentage of fraudulent claims is enormous,” McFarlane told the Mail on Sunday. “We have turned portions of Britain into fraudsters.  “It was in the government’s interests [for customers to receive PPI compensation]: consumer spending rose and it weakened the banks, so the government is complicit here in the decline of the City. This is stimulation of the economy by buying flat-screen televisions.”  But Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said it was “ridiculous” for McFarlane to turn the tables on consumers, most of whom had lodged honest claims.  “I find this a very rich comment from a banker. Let’s be straight. £50bn was mis-sold, systemically and often deliberately and yet no banker has been convicted of fraud. That’s where the outrage should be.”  He said that while some people “at the edges” will have made unfair claims, the fault lay with the banks and the structure of the policy was designed to “entrap” customers.  Figures from City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) show banks have already been forced to pay out £30bn in compensation to customers who were mis-sold the insurance, and payouts are expected to rise again ahead of a deadline for claims next August.  An estimated £50bn was paid by consumers to buy PPI policies, or £80bn once interest is added.  McFarlane said it was “almost inconceivable to think that £50bn was mis-sold”, but Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, said his comments were “a slap in the face” for consumers ripped off by the PPI scheme.  French added: “Banks still have a long way to go to restore customers’ trust in the industry, and comments like this will not help at all.  “As the FCA’s August 2019 deadline for complaints approaches, we want to see firms working with, not against, their customers to make the claims journey as simple as possible, encouraging and supporting claimants to ensure that no one misses out.”  According to the FCA, around 64m PPI policies were sold over three decades, prompting nearly 20m complaints.

The bank’s bill for PPI totals more than £9bn.  A spokesperson for the Professional Financial Claims Association, said all claims were verified by the claims management company.  He added: “What is outrageous is that so many people have PPI without knowing and their route to compensation is being shut.”",8,2018-09-23 23:51:10
222,1235,"The French hard-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon is to appear at a Labour party conference event for the first time, inviting Jeremy Corbyn to join a world club of leftist movements.  In his office at the French parliament before travelling to Liverpool, Mélenchon told the Guardian he sought to invite Corbyn to join an international club for like-minded movements. “I have a proposal to create a world club, a joint common space for parties and movements from different countries, including Africa and Asia,” he said.

225,1238,"World oil production will soar to new records over the next five years, as a dramatic expansion in demand from airlines offsets the arrival of electric cars, according to a report from Opec .  In a forecast that will dismay environmentalists – and which questions the theory that oil company reserves will become “ stranded assets ” – Opec’s annual report significantly revised production estimates upwards. Most of the production increase will come from countries outside Opec, led by explosive growth from frackers in the United States, with China and India leading the increase in demand.  Opec expects global oil demand to reach nearly 112m barrels per day by 2040, driven by transportation and petrochemicals. That is up from almost 100m today and higher than last year’s projection.  Coal will continue to be be burned in record amounts, despite concerns about its impact on climate change. Opec estimates that coal usage in the OECD countries will plummet by a third by 2040, but it will increase by 20% in developing countries to reach five times the volumes burned in the west.  The world’s airlines will be the single fastest growing user of oil, increasing consumption by 2.2% a year on average, to 2040. However, the largest absolute growth is expected to come from road transport.  The number of vehicles on roads across the world are expected to leap from 1.1bn now to around 2.4bn in 2040. In its central scenario, Opec expects just 320m of those to be electric, a number that climbs to 720m in a scenario where battery-powered cars take off rapidly.  It said that if the higher prediction for electric cars came to pass, oil demand would only slip slightly to 109m bpd rather than 111.7m bpd by 2040, the report said.  Opec revised downwards its forecast for the market share of diesel vehicles because of the fallout from the dieselgate scandal and electric strategy announcements by carmakers over the past year.  Renewable energy production will rise rapidly but even by 2040 will meet only around 20% of global energy demand by 2040, according to projections in the report.  The price of crude oil has jumped from about $50 (£38.29) a barrel in late 2016 to highs of $80 this summer, partly due to the cartel’s agreement with Russia to cut production for 18 months .   Oil price graph   Although the Opec report shies away from making price predictions, motorists are unlikely to see much in the way of relief on the forecourts. Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency warned there was a risk of oil prices spiralling higher in the coming months, posing a dilemma for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he looks to raise fuel duty.  Most oil companies expect peak oil demand will occur in the 2030s , while more bullish predictions say it could come in the 2020s as climate change regulations bite.  Opec, which was meeting in Algiers on Sunday to discuss how to share out an increase in output to bring down prices , sees the US as soaking up most of the growth in production over the next 10 years.    Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   “US tight oil is projected to grow very strongly in the period 2018–20, albeit slowing a bit thereafter, and to peak … in the latter half of the 2020s,” the World Oil Outlook report said.  While the group admits the US will beat it in the short run, it believes an American peak in the late 2020s will mean Opec remains relevant in the long run. It hopes to increase its share of world oil supply from 34% now to 40% in 2040.  The report doubts whether the pro-fossil fuel regulatory pushes by the US president, Donald Trump, will help the US oil industry, citing the fact that production soared under the “overly burdensome” regulatory environment it faced under Barack Obama’s presidency.",3,2018-09-23 23:51:25

231,1286,"Rockney was the name given to the fusion of vintage rock’n’roll music and cockney lyrics pioneered by Chas and Dave from the 1970s onwards. The singer and pianist Chas Hodges, who has died aged 74 after suffering from oesophageal cancer, and bass guitarist Dave Peacock scored hit records such as Rabbit, Gertcha and Ain’t No Pleasing You, as well as composing songs to celebrate Tottenham Hotspur’s cup successes.  Their big break came from a series of television commercials for Courage beer in the late 70s and early 80s, which used eight of their songs as soundtracks. The duo also became favourites of many television producers. They were given their own Christmas special in 1982, with guests including Eric Clapton, which was extended to an ITV series, Chas and Dave’s Knees-Up , the following year, and they often appeared on the children’s Saturday morning show Tiswas.  Chas had spent years playing bass guitar in traditional rock’n’roll bands before his decision to switch to the piano and to “rockney”. As he wrote in his 2008 autobiography, All About Us: “I felt like a fraud singing in an American accent over there [on a 1972 US tour with the band Head, Hands and Feet]. My ambition now was to write and sing a serious song in my own accent – for want of a better description, cockney.”  He switched instruments and teamed up with Dave, whom he had met in 1960 through a fellow musician and schoolmate, and who shared his musical tastes. They started with low-key shows on the Truman brewery pub circuit in and around London , sometimes playing on the same bill as Chas’s mother, Daisy, a skilled pianist.  At first Chas found it quite difficult to adopt a cockney singing style, but he solved the problem by reciting his new lyrics out loud and then, “I put the natural spoken phrasing with a melody. Eureka!”  Born in Edmonton, north London, Chas was the second son of Albert, a lorry driver, and Daisy (nee Shaw). Albert took his own life when Chas was four, and Daisy found work playing the piano in pubs. Chas attended Eldon Road primary school and, after passing the 11-plus, Higher Grade grammar school in Edmonton. At 13, he was inspired to learn the guitar after hearing early rock’n’roll records by Little Richard and others. He joined the Horseshoe skiffle group, which evolved into the Horseshoes, a rock’n’roll band playing in local pubs and youth clubs.  Expelled from school at 15, he was briefly apprenticed to a watch and clockmaker, but was dismissed for lateness. By this time, Chas was a semi-professional musician, and had bought one of Britain’s first electric bass guitars as a member of Billy Gray and the Stormers, with whom he played the 1960 summer season at Butlins holiday camp in Filey, North Yorkshire.  He made his first recordings in the early 60s with his next group, the Outlaws, supporting the singer (and later actor) Mike Berry , who was a protege of the record producer Joe Meek . Meek used the Outlaws as a house band, and Chas played on the John Leyton hits Johnny Remember Me and Wild Wind (both 1961).  With changing personnel including the future Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, the Outlaws were in demand to accompany the visiting American stars Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent, and they split from Berry. Chas became friends with Lewis, who inspired him to play the piano.  In 1965, Chas joined Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, a rock and soul band managed by the Beatles’ mentor, Brian Epstein. The following year the Bennett band toured Germany with the Beatles, and Chas heard a pre-release version of their Revolver album, discussing its merits with Paul McCartney. Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers subsequently had a hit record with Got to Get You Into My Life , a track from Revolver, produced by McCartney.  The Rebel Rousers later left Bennett, but failed to make an impact without him. Chas played on various recording sessions before joining Head, Hands and Feet, then hooked up with Dave, billing themselves as Chas and Dave from 1972.  The duo’s first album, One Fing ’n’ Anuvver (1975), soon received airplay on music historian Charlie Gillett ’s show on BBC Radio London. A national tour supporting 10cc followed, but the biggest boost to the duo’s career came from the Courage ads. Among the eight songs used as soundtracks were the top 20 hit singles Gertcha (1979), Rabbit (1980) and Ain’t No Pleasing You, an uncharacteristic slow ballad that became their biggest hit, reaching No 2 in 1982, as well as Margate the same year and The Sideboard Song (1979).  As ardent fans of Spurs, Chas and Dave were well placed to write and produce several hit singles performed by the Tottenham Hotspur FA Cup squads. The most successful of these was Ossie’s Dream (in tribute to the player and coach Ossie Ardiles), a No 5 hit in 1981, and Hotshot Tottenham , which reached no 19 in 1987. There was also a collaboration with Barry Hearn’s stable of snooker stars, credited as the Matchroom Mob, on Snooker Loopy , a No 6 hit in 1986.  The duo recorded a stream of albums, including Don’t Give a Monkey’s… (1979) and Well Pleased (1984). However it was the sing- along collections that amassed the biggest sales, with Chas and Dave’s Street Party: 50 Classic Songs Which Helped Win the War reaching No 3 in 1995. They had a renaissance in recent years, playing the Glastonbury festival in 2005 and 2007.  In 2009 Dave’s wife died, after which he became less active. They reunited in 2013 for two final albums, That’s What Happens and A Little Bit of Us, which returned them to their roots, and in 2014 Chas released a solo album, Together We Made Music.  In recent years, Chas became an enthusiastic gardener and contributed a column, Rock ’n’ Roll Allotment, to the Daily Express.  He is survived by his wife, Joan, a model and former Playboy “bunny”, whom he married in 1966, his children, Juliet, Kate and Nicholas, and two grandchildren.  • Chas (Charles Nicholas) Hodges, singer, songwriter and pianist, born 28 December 1943; died 22 September 2018",9,2018-09-23 23:51:45
232,1287,"A teenager is recovering in hospital after being shot four times in County Antrim.  The 18-year-old man was shot in each arm and leg in the early hours of Sunday, in what police have described as a paramilitary-style attack.  His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening at this stage.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the “brutal” attack took place at a house in the Moneycannon Road area of Ballymoney.  Insp Vince Redmond of the PSNI said the man is being treated in hospital for his injuries.  “We received a report that an 18-year-old man had been shot four times, once in each arm and leg, at around 3.30am this morning by unknown intruders,” he said.  Redmond urged anyone with information about the attack to contact police.  “Our inquiries are at a very early stage into what was a brutal attack on a young man in his home by dangerous and violent individuals, and I would ask anyone with any information which could assist us to apprehend those responsible to contact detectives at Coleraine on 101 quoting reference number 324 23/09/18,” he said.

There should be no room in our society for self-appointed enforcers and their weapons of death and destruction.”  The Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said: “There can be no acceptance for such attacks. Paramilitary assaults and coercive control must always be challenged.  “Those with knowledge behind this and other similar brutal and vile attacks need to come forward and provide information to the police.

They immediately notified port authorities and awaited their instruction.”  The pallets turned out to contain “quite the cache”, the DCJ said: 540 packages of cocaine in 45 boxes of bananas, “with an estimated street value of $17,820,000” .  The DCJ said federal officials and US Customs and Border Protection were investigating.  “What a find by the boys in grey!” it said.",3,2018-09-23 23:51:57
235,1302,"Theresa May will come under intense pressure from leading Brexiters on Monday to ditch her Chequers proposals and back a free trade deal with the EU instead as she faces a bruising cabinet showdown in the wake of the disastrous Salzburg summit.  Former Brexit secretary David Davis and leading Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg are among those backing a report by the Institute of Economic Affairs which is expected to set out an alternative plan for a hard Brexit departure from the EU.  The launch, attended by a series of high-profile Brexiters, comes just hours before the prime minister comes face-to-face with her cabinet for the first time since her humiliation at the hands of EU leaders who rejected key elements of her Chequers plan.",3,2018-09-23 23:51:59
236,1303,"Senior allies of Jeremy Corbyn questioned the rationale for a fresh Brexit referendum on Sunday, as grassroots Labour campaigners ramped up the pressure on the party to shift its position towards a “people’s vote”.  Corbyn raised hopes for a new referendum when he told the Sunday Mirror he would support the idea if members vote for it when Brexit is debated at Labour’s conference in Liverpool on Tuesday.  “I was elected to empower the members of the party. So if conference makes a decision, I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly,” he said.  However, as more than 100 delegates gathered for a “compositing” meeting on Sunday evening to thrash out a Brexit motion that will be voted on by conference, a string of his senior supporters underlined their concerns about a “people’s vote”.  The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, whose Salford constituency voted leave, told the Guardian she was concerned the Tories would be able to dictate the question.",3,2018-09-23 23:52:06
237,1304,"A man in his 80s has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was found dead in Norfolk.  Police were called to reports a woman had been stabbed in a property in Brooke, south of Norwich, at about 10.30am on Sunday.  The victim, whose age Norfolk police did not disclose, was pronounced dead at the scene when police arrived to Churchill Place. A police cordon remains in place while officers carry out inquiries.  It has already been established that the man and woman were known to each other.  “Clearly we are still in the early stages of our investigation and our enquiries remain ongoing,” said DI Chris Burgess.  “However, it appears that the suspect and the victim were known to each other and we do not believe there to be any threat to the wider public.”  The man was detained at Norfolk and Norwich hospital and will be questioned at Wymondham police investigation centre.",3,2018-09-23 23:52:09
238,1305,"A year ago, the Labour party conference in Brighton was more like a four-day celebration. Mostly of Jeremy Corbyn. Against the odds, the Labour leader had rubbed out the Tory overall majority with an energised campaign and the party had come back from the dead. It was a defeat that felt like a victory and the conference treated it as such. It became almost obligatory for every speaker to begin their turns with their personal thanks and indebtedness to Jeremy. The more critical the speaker had previously been, the longer the eulogy was expected to be. Tom Watson’s lasted for about 10 minutes. Even he was cringing by the end.  Twelve months on and some of the euphoria has worn off. Despite the Tories having achieved nothing of any note and being openly at war with one another over Brexit, Labour has failed to make any progress in the polls. In a two-horse race for who would make the best prime minister, Corbyn is still coming third – just behind Theresa May and a long way behind “Don’t know”.",9,2018-09-23 23:52:12
239,1306,"Labour has confirmed that its one-day music and politics festival Labour Live did not make a profit. The party’s treasurer, Diana Holland, said she did not believe a desire to make money was the reason for running it.  The event, nicknamed JezFest , featured speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, performances from the bands Clean Bandit and the Magic Numbers, and political discussions.  More than 13,000 tickets were sold for the June event in Tottenham, north London. Prices were cut to £10 in an attempt to boost sales. After a slow start to the day, the festival was well attended by a diverse audience.  Johanna Baxter, a former member of the party’s ruling national executive committee, asked at the Labour conference how much the festival cost to organise, whether a profit was made and whether it would be repeated.  Holland replied: “No, Labour Live did not make a profit. I don’t think that was why it was organised; however, there was a net cost. It’ll be included in next year’s financial report.  “But this was met by part of the reserve fund we have established in addition to the general election fund, so absolutely none of that was touched but we did use some of our reserves in order to fund that.”  Corbyn’s keynote speech at the event revived memories of his appearance at Glastonbury last year as he called on festivalgoers to come together to eradicate inequality.  He said the Conservatives were “incapable of governing” and ideologically wedded to free market economic theories that had led to a decline in both the quality and availability of public services.  Political festivals are growing in popularity, with Momentum’s parallel event to Labour’s annual conference, The World Transformed, sparking spinoffs around the country. This month around 1,000 people attended the Big Tent Ideas festival in Cambridgeshire for a series of discussions on subjects ranging from heritage in the digital age to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.  Although the Cambridgeshire event was touted as non-party political, it was dominated by Conservative party members and centre-right ideas. It is unclear whether the festival, which took place in the grounds of a stately home, made a profit.  Beyond party politics, the Byline festival – billed as promoting independent journalism and free speech – took place for a second year this summer.",3,2018-09-23 23:52:19
